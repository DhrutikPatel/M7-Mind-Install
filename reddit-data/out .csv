"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement"
I'm sorry did you say suicide fetishists? As in people who actually find pleasure in others committing suicide?
"I didn’t necessarily see this addressed, perhaps I overlooked it. I personally think the whole “it gets better” campaign was BS. It’s not 100% true, yay for those whose lives have improved and they can honestly look back and say wow, I’m really glad I didn’t die. Is that little bandaid still discouraged? I hope so. Because as someone who has wanted to die (not necessarily kill myself) since I was probably at least 25, and I’m now 48 and at the lowest point I’ve been, it does not get better. And it can get worse. 

I would never encourage anyone to kill themselves. But if their mind is made up, I want them to know it’s ok, I want them to be at peace because it’s obviously not with them now."
"I read so much about what NOT to do, what not to say. Just let the person know you are there for them. ""It must be hard to feel this way"" blabla. OKAY. Nice. That works fine the first time, maybe a second time the person tells you that. But if this person repeats themselfs OVER AND OVER AGAIN. For the last fucking 3 years, every day, everrrryyy fucking day, WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY? If they keep saying that they are useless, that nothing is gonna help, that they need to die, that everyone is better off without them, everyday. What am I supposed to respond? Evertyime just ""oh it must be hard to feel this way"" or ""I wish I could help you get better"". Just let them sit there and not try to find a way out? This person extects help. Would be great if you gave tips about how to behave THEN. The long-term-conversation."
"For the longest time, I thought this was a sub in which people could share their suicidal tendencies without judgement or ridicule and find support...not to stay alive, but in whatever decision they ended up making. Definitely wrong about that."
Bruuuh if a sane person wants to die it’s their right.
"Oh my gosh thank you for this.  Sometimes I feel like I'm annoying for reporting so much posts and comments, but it was disturbing me."
Everyone in the place is just incredibly condescending.
"I don't know why, but that simple phrase ""I hope you find peace"" riles me up. Like you said, it just feels like dismissiveness and a lack of willingness to actually try talking to and comforting the person. And people on this sub continue to use it even after you outline it's a form of ""covert shunning."""
">This undermines our purpose here

Not trying to be funny, but what *is* your purpose? I've been coming here for years and it seems like this place is only helpful for people who have made attempts. Any other posts are either ignored or closed/locked."
"This just kind of makes me feel afraid to post here, like I’ll get banned for expressing the pain that makes me want to kill myself. It just adds to my sense of rejection like not even this place wants me. Thanks. I’ll just keep it to myself like always"
Some subs let you state which sub rule is broken when you report on mobile. Is there a reason that's not the case here? Itd make it easier for mobile users to help.
"This is kinda why I stopped commenting, I find it hard not to start accidentally agreeing when I myself truly want to die."
"I read the wiki. And I’ve got a question.

I don’t know why but I feel like a good way to help people is to be perfectly blunt and honest with them. No forms of sugaring it up with cliche and lazy phrases including “it gets better” or “please don’t do it” but I have my own way that I want to know if it’s appropriate. Something along the lines of a response i might do is below.

“I’m not going to tell you that I understand what you’re going through, or what your life is like. I can’t promise that your life will get better. But just remember, if you’re thinking about going through with killing yourself, just remember that you don’t get a second chance, no take backs or anything like that. Be sure to remember the things that you could lose by going through with it. Would suicide solve all of your problems or just create more? That’s up for you to decide. I refuse to encourage either side, make your decision in the way you see fit. Promise me that you’ll make the choice that benefits you, and you only.”"
"I wish this sub was more free, more open. If and when I write my own last post; I wouldn't want people to be banned for wishing me good luck. That it's okay to finally let go, you know? Some people just need reassurance. That the darkness is finally ending, that it's okay to finally go into that good night. 

I agree that ""lol do it"" or anything aggressively promoting suicide is problematic and shouldn't be encouraged. But there's unity in knowing that people understand and that they're in the same boat. I've seen people unfairly banned for that. Someone was offering their sincere hopes that whatever an OP did that they would find the solace they couldn't here, in the now. And bam! Banned for life.  

I haven't said anything remotely like that but I'm a bit paranoid I'll be banned for even mentioning it. posting from another account just so my main one doesn't get roasted for asking"
Is there any good place to discuss the pros and cons of death? I am not suicidal but just curious
Absolute bullshite.
"Thank you so much for taking the time to write this! I am recently new to reddit; I decided to get it after finding this subreddit as I found it comforting to know I wasn’t alone in this battle and that if I had things to share but nobody in my life to share it to, I could come here. I was surprised about a lot of the responses though, especially where people would say “I hope you find peace, good luck,” and was under the impression that this was a really nice, supportive comment sand was the way you should go about talking to suicidal people. But, this post completely puts it into the right perspective, so thank you for taking the time out to correct this misinformation. I will make sure to take this on board in the future."
I learned things
"I know this may sound strange, but, once when I was feeling suicidal, a friend told me that, if I did he would understand. He said that, although he hoped that I wouldn't,he would understand and support whichever decision I made. For some reason that was a very interesting moment because, for me, it kinda helped. It felt like someone actually understood what I was feeling. Whenever I confess to feeling like that, I usually get met with ""it gets better"" ""things could be much worse"" or something like those.
I'm not saying that this would work for anyone other than me, just relaying my strange experience. Or, I would consider it strange."
"No offense, but last time I asked for help on this subreddit the only response I got was encouragement to kill myself and a few, ""oh, I'm sorry but not really"" crap So yeah, it's a thing.

Look, I know you guys have been really wonderful and have been working really hard to help many on this subreddit. I don't mean this as a discouragement, but as a to affirm what was said above.

And as for the curators, thank you guys. It may be difficult to be here all the time, but I know that what you do does make a difference."
"Thank you for this sub. I never imagined something like this existed on social media, So much knowledge and experience demonstrated in this thread. /respect"
Thank you for having clear boundaries for this community!
Brutally forcing someone to stay alive.
"I made a point out of reading as many posts I could when I could, and reporting both posts and replies that made me feel uncomfortable regarding the scope of this subreddit. That said there was never any feedback. I understand it's quite feasible that a lot of things I reported may have been deemed acceptable or have been reported multiple times. 

That said however it has lead me to cherry pick posts where I can mostly share my experiences to help a person and ignore comments from others unless in the thread of conversation. I understand giving direct feedback all the time is a lot to ask but letting users know that their feedback is received and acknowledged? I'm not here with a solution but a representation of my predicament."

Thank you
"But what; is this sub, like help for people who contemplate suicide or something, I’m having trouble understanding it"
"I voted this down because most people don't know what suicide is and hiding the ""mechanics"" of suicide from those who might attempt it and presenting ""suicide"" as a ""moral failing"" on their part (instead of showing suicide for what it really is -- this society mean-spiritedly presenting the people it injures with false 'alternatives,' then blaming those people for taking them) has never -- and will never -- save a single person from taking their own life.  No one, not even the most desperate, really wants to be strangled to death or wants their death to create a ""such a big mess that it will take an army of sanitation workers to clean it up,"" yet that's precisely what taking sleeping pills and alcohol, hanging oneself, or shooting oneself involves (but where are those methods ever portrayed like that, instead of as ""instant death"" or ""drifting off to sleep,"" in popular depictions of suicide?) Our evil, mean-spirited, society even tells people (in popular depictions of suicide) that ""slitting their wrists"" is a ""viable option"" for ""killing themselves"" when, in fact, the average person (of this day and age) would probably faint (from the pain) before they cut deep enough reach -- let alone open -- an artery.  So no, it's not those who are saying ""Do you really want to strangle yourself for those assholes???"" or asking those who say they're going to ""shoot themselves in the head"" with a handgun ""What if you miss: do you really want to spend the rest of your life in a nursing home???"" who are ""accidentally encouraging suicide"" (let alone ""covertly inciting it."")"

So this reddit is for prevention?
"Im glad the wiki has a lot of what not to say in certain situations, but I would also like to hear better alternatives of what to say in similar situations."
"I just want to say that it's awesome that this community exists.
I by no means have suicidal thoughts (never have) but it occured to me that even though I'm comfortable in life, all I can say is that while I used to not understand why people do it, I can see now how it happens. I find how we handle this issue unacceptable as a society, so I am wondering if it is possible to work as an anti suicide counselor part time as a student/ in the military?
I ask because we have student EMTs so why not alleviate a shift on a hotline or something or is that generally seen as too much responsibility for a part time worker?"
"What a very informative and awesome post someone decided to take the time out of their day to create, great result."
Im new to reddit. Does anyone know of a group for families of someone that has passed from suicide?
Hey mods I have a question what should I do when I want to help but know that I can't say the proper words?
Nice to see this here! and Nicely written!
"Hi. Are there resources for caregivers? My post was removed from r/relationships for being suicide-related, when my problem is that I have a one-sided relationship with a person who wants to commit suicide. For the last 2 or 3 years, they have literally only called me drunk and incoherent, threatening to commit suicide and verbally abusing me. I don't think I can continue to support this individual if their behavior doesn't change. I feel at my wits end and I don't know else to help. This individual has had a very hard life but is also an alcoholic and can be extremely verbally abusive."

I'm in trouble. And you would be a saint if you child help."
"Ty for posting this, reading the guidelines made me understand myself a lot more and i don't feel like complete garbarge anymore. It's rough.. have a nice day my friends"
"Huh. I think I've broken the rules. I agree with a lot of this and appreciate the research put into it but I think this misses the mark in a couple places. Why would someone come to a subreddit for suicidal people to talk about their suicide, and actively avoid the more squishy, positivity oriented spaces that exist?

1. To share their final thoughts with anyone they can.

2. To explore the ideations of other suicidals, likely because they're not entirely convinced yet and still debating it.

3. To empathize or find empathy with other people feeling the same way.

Not to be blatantly talked out of it. Strangers trying to fix your depression is annoying af. And the fact that people only passively want you to stay alive for their own personal peace of mind but don't actually give a shit about you beyond that is usually a factor in what has led them to this point to begin with.

Not only do I think there's nothing wrong with talking to someone about suicide while explicitly reassuring them that you're not interested in stopping them from doing it. I think that approaching someone who has made up their mind as though they're a fully functional adult who has likely put sufficient consideration into their decisions and doesn't owe you an explanation or opportunity to debate their reasoning can disarm the apprehension towards apathetic virtue signaling and allow said suicide risk's mind a bit of ease and relaxation that can be vital in one last critical analysis of their decisions... Which may well lead to a reconsideration. 

It's ok to just be there for another human being without trying to manipulate them into conforming to some societal standard.

Edit: also a little dark humor goes a long way in some cases. And if a simple internet comment from a stranger is enough to push someone over the edge and actually do it, well then they were gonna do it either way."

I am too much of a pussy to single myself out and make a whole post.. but I really feel so down and oh so full of desires to take my life. It's kinda helping to just read and read and read so much. And there's good people here.. And the mods are kind and empathic too and knowledgeable. I have to keep trying to distract myself. I'm sorry guys. Thanks for the good people in the world. I have to make it to DBT group tomorrow. so close to tomorrow... But it keeps coming and it doesn't make sense I want it to come.. But then dying is so much easier when you're a little bitch like me fuck. Good night I hope you alls sleep well and hopefully no suicsde
"All those rules don't leave very much.  So, random thoughts then ...

I wonder if suicide encouragers / fetishists are just sadists or are they potentially suicidal or depressive themselves and are projecting those feelings onto others, i.e. vicarious suicide.  


Been off & on suicidal (autothanasic?) since my teens years myself.  I wonder if a suicidally oriented or depressive person can be a better communicator with a suicidal person than someone who does not have these feelings as strongly.  


I realize I'm conflating depression/suicidality here just as shorthand but I'm aware they are correlated but not identical.  A bipolar person in a hypomanic or manic episode is more likely to become suicidal than when the same person is in a depressive episode -- the extra energy boost of hypomania can be just enough to make ""muscle memory"" or kinesthetic habit take over.  There've been times when I am in a hypomanic state where I might punch a hole in the wall (which just means I have to fix it later) or smash an old ukulele or a dish or something inexpensive but which will make a satisfying destructive event, but I also have to remind myself to stay away from a knife or box cutter during these episodes because the kinesthetic urge can take over from the rational part of the brain (forebrain or whatever it is.)  


I've called ""crisis hotlines"" and ""warmlines"" a few times but I have not been satisfied with the results, just frustrated. Their responses sound canned and too practiced, like they all studied and memorized this wiki by heart (no offense.)  Could probably write a separate post on this because this statement may sound more critical than intended.  


Have more thoughts but this looks long enough for now."
"as a suicidal person who has lost passion to put forth effort in life, i thank you from the bottom of my heart for putting forth the effort to create this sub and make solutions to make it better."

Well done for highlighting this
"So, in a nutshell, what IS the right thing to say to someone who is suicidal? I've always said your life will get better just keep moving forward one step at a time. Apparently, that's a bad response if I'm reading this thread correctly. I don't want to accidentally push someone over the edge. I somewhat understand what people go through. It's as if there is an empty spot in your soul that you're trying to furfill but it never does. That's how I feel. (( I am not trying to make this post about me, I am explaining how I feel because when someone speaks of suicide I automatically think about what I'm going through and I tell them what may get them out of the pit.)) Overall, I'd like to learn the pychology and the verbal skills to stop people from commiting suicide actions or thoughts. It's nature to be drawn to negative energy rather than positive. Let's try to spread the positive energy and save as many people as we can. I love you all and I hope to get some good advice on how to make this world a better place, starting with the man in the mirror."

I am not sure how it could get any more ""addressed"".

However it's a false dichotomy to imply that the only two choices are ""it gets better"" and ""be at peace with your 'choice' to die"". That's just never true in the case of despondent suicidal thought.  Both those responses are equally thoughtless."
"saying this more to apply 2 myself than others but if it doesnt get better, why bother?"
Isn't this covert support? The last paragraph.
You sound depressed. Are you okay?
"I could sense desperation in your comment and want to offer you some help on this.

&#x200B;

Everyone's case is different but I can tell you from my perspective. I hope it is useful.

Just be a friend as normal as possible. Don't make a big deal out of them being suicidal each time you speak to them (that doesn't mean you don't care).

My dad calls me and the first thing he says is ""Hi I was just calling to see how you are""

This immediately makes the topic of conversation about my suicidal thoughts/depression. It also tells me that my state of mind is affecting his and making him worry. Neither of those two things help. I now only seem to talk about my condition with him. That's my fault too though, not just his. He's not a psychologist and is trying his best. I just miss normal chats about normal things.

&#x200B;

I miss my Dad calling me to ask me if I watched the boxing. I miss normality.

&#x200B;

Try to give them normality. Just ask if they want to go out for lunch or to see a show. Even staying in with them to watch crap on TV or  anything. The old personality is still in there somewhere.

The offer needs to be available to them but not pushed on them. Sometimes they'll say ""no thanks"" and choose to stay isolated but don't be offended by that or worry. They don't want to see anyone at the moment and it's nothing personal against you. Just let them know you'd like to do something and that the offer is there if they change their mind.

Just send them random funny text messages that you know will make them laugh. Call them and talk about stuff. Anything but depression and suicide.  Just try and seem like you're not even thinking about them being so depressed. Even though you are.

&#x200B;

If they often want to talk to you about how crap they feel. Then I can see how tedious that would get after a while.  I only talk to people about how I'm feeing when asked. I haven't just called my dad to tell him how crap I feel for a long time. I'd feel like I was ruining his day and I would be. Not telling him means I end up just feeling like crap on my own though, and I suppose that isn't good either. It is a bit of an emotional mine field.

Basically, they need your help but genuinely don't want to burden you and make you go to a bunch of effort just for them. That just adds something else to their misery list. So you have to help but in a way that seems natural and just normal.

&#x200B;

Tell them YOU need help with something. Gardening, decorating, anything. Make something up. That will probably help them so much actually. They'll have a purpose and be doing something that will make them know they are needed and helping someone they care about.

They need happiness. Try to create happy times. But don't be all ""Hey let's do fun stuff to stop you wanting to end yourself"".

&#x200B;

I hope I made some kind of sense."
Our talking tips post covers all this.
"Nothing we're saying here has anything to do with judgement or ridicule, which will never be allowed here.   

This whole post is about *not* trying to change people's minds in favour of suicide, because that's the opposite of supportive.  But we agree that trying to change people's minds against it is equally unsupportive,  and counterproductive."
There is a difference between encouraging people to commit suicide and validating and empathizing the feelings that would read to suicide.
It’s fucking bullshit. Does anyone know of any website where we can actually act on our right to free speech? Please let me know. I’m done with this sub.
"We agree, and everything we've said here is perfectly consistent with that.  

But, there are some things that people have a perfect right to do that are still harmful to themselves and to others.  Validating those intentions is always abusive.  

Validating people's feelings instead *in no way* challenges anyone's rights.  Trying to influence people either way often does, though.  

We're just as much against arguing against suicide as arguing for it.  They both have bad effects."
Hopefully having this stickied will raise awareness and at least cut down on the accidental incitement.
How so?
Please report it whenever find it.  We'll outright ban for this if needed.
"Late response, but to me that is the only genuine sentiment here. It makes me feel like someone acknowledges that it’s painful here, all the time, no matter what. So thank you for saying that you hope I do get to experience peace after all this suffering. My feelings are validated. I hate the “it gets better” or “what can I do” responses. It doesn’t get better, and if I can’t do shit for my sled, then how can anyone else, realistically?

Thanks for letting me vent."
"This is a *support* space, and we have a narrow focus, so it's heavily moderated.  We limit posts to requests for support, but our criteria have nothing to do with whether someone has disclosed suicidal behaviour or not.

As for the larger question, this sub exists because, in the early days of reddit, it was found to be impossible to stop people from posting about their suicidal thoughts and feelings, so the harm-reduction option was to carve out the safest space we could (kind of an oxymoron on a wide-open anonymous platform like reddit, but we do the best we can) and encourage the community to provide non-judgemental support.  

The [best description that I know of actually came from an outside observer a few years ago](https://slate.com/technology/2015/03/reddit-and-suicide-intervention-how-social-media-is-changing-the-cry-for-help-and-the-answer.html), but Amanda Hess is an excellent journalist :-)"
"We wouldn't ban someone for expressing their own suicidal thoughts!   Our goal is always to provide the safest possible space for that, although 100% safety on the wide-open internet will never be achievable."
"Our guidelines don't fit the reddit rules format very well.  We're working on that, but since we humans look at all the reports personally it matters a lot less which reason you pick."
"As a ""support"" tactic that will usually turn out to worse than useless.  Basically you're asking somebody who's probably in so much pain that their cognition is severely compromised to engage in a thought experiement.  The likely results of this are:

*  The insensitivity of a response that shows a complete misunderstanding of their experience will likely escalate their sense of alienation.  That is one of the two most critical factors linked to suicidal intent.

*  Their inability to feel better after receiving this kind of ""help"" will likely increase their sense of failure and unworthiness, which is the other top critical factor linked to suicidal intent.

Besides all that, your basic premise seems to be that contemplating the finality of death would be a deterrent.  Sorry, but the kindest way I can describe that is plain stupid.  If you've lost your connection to your survival instinct, the finality of death is an inducement."
"That's a lot of pressure for someone that may be already crumbling under it.   
It also sounds a bit guilt inducing."
"The whole point of this post is that there are better ways to offer solace than validating someone's suicidal intent and self-hatred.  You're using words like ""free"" and ""open"" and trying to link those words with an environment where suicide voyeurism and incitement are tolerated. 

> Some people just need reassurance. That the darkness is finally ending, that it's okay to finally go into that good night. 

You can use all the comforting language you want.  That doesn't change the fact that you're just dressing up suicide incitement.  ""It's okay to go into that good night"" is just a way of telling someone ""you're not welcome *here*"".    

In general, though, our moderation philosophy is to be extremely strict with the peoole who are giving support, but lenient with those who are here to get it.

I've never seen anyone who made a big deal out of being ""unfairly banned"" by us who wasn't also lying about the actual reasons."
Philosophical questions of that nature should go to one of the philosophy subs.
What do you mean?
"One thing that we just noticed, it's far better to indicate that we respect someone's ownership of their life, than to in any way say that we ""support"" their decision to end their life, even obliquely.  So I'd like to add that caveat to my original reply to you.  

It's a fine line, but it's an important one."
"Just to add on a bit to what /u/SQLwitch said - feeling genuinely cared about and understood without judgement is the most important factor that could make this feel like good support rather than incitement. It's also easier for a friend to compensate for mistakes if someone takes something the wrong way.

In an online context like SW, where people are usually talking with strangers and misunderstandings can be harder to fix, and also where voyeurs frequently just say “you have the right to do it” or similar without even trying to ease anyone’s suffering, it’s even more important to offer empathetic support for the reasons people are thinking about suicide in the first place (as the talking tips indicate), in addition to not judging suicidal thoughts."
"As you can see from [our talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87), this is great support and not at all what we mean by incitement."
"Really sorry that you didn't have a good response to your post here.  Trying to make sure everybody gets quality, supportive replies here is a larger issue - but preventing incitement (deliberate or accidental) is part of it.  

We're always thinking about how to ""help the helpers"" and we're working on some resources behind the scenes, as our time permits."

But we try to provide some education about how to do it effectively.  We think the only ethical way to do suicide intervention is to help people feel better.  If you give real understanding and support, prevention is a fortunate side-effect.  If you try to change people's minds, it usually backfires.  If you subject someone to an involuntary intervention, the traumatic violation often does more harm than good in the long run."

Yikes, what an awful thing to do to you.  

Can you tell me a bit more about them, their mental-health history, and the history of the relationship?   My spidey-senses are tingling but I don't want to go *just* by that."
Sorry for the slow reply.  Sometimes I totally lost control of my personal inbox.  Glad to help if I still can.

Thanks, so glad to hear that.  Wish you the best."
"I'm not sure that what you're disagreeing with is actually in this post, though.  At least, we didn't *mean* to put it in here.  

We're definitely *not* advocating for ""talking people out of it"" - direct persuasion usually backfires.  It's not the way to ease someone's pain or help them feel less alone.  

And we have no problem with people sharing their own dark feelings in response to someone's post. That's in no way the same thing as validating someone's suicidal intent.   

>  I think that approaching someone who has made up their mind as though they're a fully functional adult who has likely put sufficient consideration into their decisions and doesn't owe you an explanation or opportunity to debate their reasoning can disarm the apprehension towards apathetic virtue signaling and allow said suicide risk's mind a bit of ease and relaxation that can be vital in one last critical analysis of their decisions...

Well, sure, and I don't see anything in this post that's against that.

> It's ok to just be there for another human being without trying to manipulate them into conforming to some societal standard.

Of course.  And, again, where do you think we're saying anything otherwise?

You don't need to endorse suicidal intent to feel and demonstrate respect for people's ownership of their lives.  I've been part of the training team for a couple thousand suicide hotline responders and the ones who don't do the latter always wash out.  They get emotionally invested in the clients' outcomes and that's toxic AF.  The [PSA post linked from point 4d](http://redd.it/25igd7) in the guidelines (in the sidebar/community info) goes into the perils of outcome-based thinking from a slightly different angle.  

I think you'd probably agree with the training mantra that I use at the hotline:  ""90% of the time, the rapport *is* the solution"".   

Quite a few of our rules that apply to helpers are more strict than they need to be in all cases - but because this is a public support space, there are quite a few things that can work in some cases which are not allowed because we're found that they have an unacceptably high backfire rate. 

Another wrinkle is that we have no reason to think that the 90/10/1 rule doesn't work here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet, and so our responders aren't just speaking to our OPs, and we all need to keep that in mind.  

I do have one point where both we and the science may disagree with you.  You seem imply in a couple of places that there's a ""point of no return"" where someone can't be helped.  It's impossible to prove that that never happens, but the evidence is overwhelming that even the people who act most desperately and violently to try and end their lives can usually be helped."

"> While I know how to correctly stop people from committing suicide due to personal experience with depression

There are at least three serious things wrong with the assumptions underlying this statement.

First of all, depression and suicidality are completely different things.  The relationship between depression and suicide is correlational, not causal.  Depression doesn't make people suicidal, but some of the same things that contribute to depression also contribute to suicidality.  And although there's a consistent positive correlation between depression and suicidal *thought*, the relationship between depression and suicidal *behaviour* is less clear.  Sometimes the correlation is found to be neutral or even negative.  For example, suicides peak in the spring in both hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression.

Second, it's not wise to assume that similar lived experience helps us empathise with others.  Often the opposite is true - people end up projecting instead of empathising.  

Third, there's no ""correct"" way to do suicide intervention.  It's a highly complex and individualised process."
?
"I'm so sorry that you're feeling so low.  I'm even more sorry that you sound like you feel unworthy of help - in my ""knowledgeable"" (your word!) opinion, I think that worthiness of help is 100% determined by need.  

I hope group goes well tomorrow.  If you ever need support but don't want to post for any reason, you're always welcome to [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch).  We're not a hotline and we can't guarantee an immediate response, but we do care and we are interested in understanding what you're feeling and what you're going through."
"> I realize I'm conflating depression/suicidality here just as shorthand but I'm aware they are correlated but not identical.

More precisely, there's a pretty consistent positive correlation between depression and suicidal *thought*...

> . A bipolar person in a hypomanic or manic episode is more likely to become suicidal than when the same person is in a depressive episode

...but this is one of the many reasons why the correlation between depression and suicidal *behaviour* is less clear, and in some situations an inverse relationship is seen.  Another example, is that deaths by suicide peak in the spring in both hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression.  

> I've called ""crisis hotlines"" and ""warmlines"" a few times but I have not been satisfied with the results, just frustrated. Their responses sound canned and too practiced, like they all studied and memorized this wiki by heart (no offense.) 

I'm all too well aware that the quality of service callers receive varies widely, and bad experiences seem to be particularly common with the US national hotline.  (One of so many reasons I'm happy I'm not American these days.).  The [AAS does have an accreditation process](https://suicidology.org/training-accreditation/crisis-center-accreditation/) which I hope will eventually help somewhat if it gets adopted widely enough, and once all the workers who are actually staffing the lines were trained after the standards are adopted.  But I don't think the standards go nearly far enough, nor do they address the issue of cognitive load on the responders, which I think is probably the largest single cause of responders appearing to be disengaged with callers.  The [IASP also has a helplines best practices special-interest group](https://www.iasp.info/helplines_best_practices.php) in which I participate, which I think will eventually lead to better standards, but I fear that global adoption might be like the metric system, where the Americans stick with their substandard system just because it's theirs.  

> I wonder if suicide encouragers / fetishists are just sadists or are they potentially suicidal or depressive themselves and are projecting those feelings onto others, i.e. vicarious suicide. 

I think that both those types of people exist, and in an anonymous text-only context, it can be really tricky to distinguish between them even though one group wants to hurt others and one wants their pain to be understood.  One reason why it's hard is that so many people who are struggling with suicidal despair also have such a low level of emotional literacy that they can't distinguish emotions from beliefs and intentions, so even when they're trying to express their feelings and get them validated, what they actually express is not in the language of feelings at all.  But if their emotional literacy were better, chances are their general mental health would be better as well.  ::sigh:: 

>  I wonder if a suicidally oriented or depressive person can be a better communicator with a suicidal person than someone who does not have these feelings as strongly. 

Absolutely.  We have a saying that sometimes the best person to pull someone back from the edge is the person who's standing right behind them.

I find that immensely disturbing. I went ahead and read that Wikipedia article on Dr. McSuicide but couldn't bring myself to read the rest of it. I mean I've accidentally encouraged suicide on countless occasions out of cluelessness or carelessness but to do it deliberately and with such effort is... intensely disturbing.
"In fairness, it's not like you have any real control over what you find pleasure in. If your brain tells you that it makes you happy, then it does. There's not a damn thing you can do about it.

There is a pretty disturbing thing that brings me pleasure (no, I'm not saying what it is). It's not suicide, but it is something that, well, if you knew what it was, you'd say that I'm fucked up and I need to stop this. I wish I didn't find pleasure in it, but there's no real way to stop myself from enjoying it.

The key is to just use my imagination and pretend it's happening, rather than acting on it for real. As long as it's just pretend, then it doesn't really matter.

Suicide fetishists are the same way. As disturbing as it sounds... they can't control it, so don't blame them for being this way. They just need to find a way to pretend it's happening without it really happening so that it doesn't affect any real lives."

Many people I’ve spoken to have gotten better.

Biggest example I can give, 1 year ago, a 16 year old was going to jump on New Year’s Eve. I spoke with them for a few hours until they went away from the edge.

They are now happy.

I think it not getting better doesn’t mean I can’t make it better for someone else.

Not to say you should suffer in the hopes of helping others. It’s just my personal perspective and I don’t know how much longer I’ll stick around, but I’m trying to make it a little better for others until it happens. :3

"You're right. These rules 99% seem rational and well researched and make sense. The issue that I was raising was in relation to the implications, and perhaps better described as a lack of specificity about- the implications of likelihood that someone ""condoning"" suicidal ideation may be secretly inciting suicide. The cited sources help to create a potential inflated perception of this type of behavior. I do appreciate your rational response, and would like to add that I in no way assume to have any greater level of insight on the matter than anyone else. My training is limited relative to specialized psychiatric and psychological expertise, and I can see that the experience involved here is substantial.

I didn't mean to suggest that there is a point of no return, I'm struggling to figure out which statement made that impression. I will venture a guess that it was the remark about an internet comment being blamed for being the deciding factor for someone to kill themselves. If that's the point in question, I'd suggest that I meant quite the opposite. That I don't believe that kind of negative reinforcement (unless prolonged and excessive while being sought after and encouraged by the victim) wields a significant power in the decision making process, but adversely a comment of the same weight can have a real effect in dissuasion. 

My argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state. And the worst outcome of it is at the very least providing some respect and dignity in a person's final moments.

Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement. But I may be misreading. If so, the lack of clarity there may be worth addressing. Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.

Anyways, thank you for responding, and entertaining my confusion."

"> not to use the cliche “I understand your feelings” kinda response

It's useless to *say* ""I understand your feelings"", but it's *essential* to both do the cognitive work yourself to understand the person's emotions (this is possible even if you don't share experience, since although there's an infinite variety of experience, there are only a few basic emotions), and *prove to them*, rather than just saying it, that you do understand.  

> They’re smart enough to know my intention

It isn't a matter of intelligence.  Most suicidal people have been so beaten down, and let down, by the rest of humanity that they can't take goodwill for granted.

>  I think it would work for people who say the “goodbye” posts

I can't imagine why you'd think that.  No matter how people choose to express their suicidal feelings, i.e. directly or via the metaphor of their suicidal ideation,  they have the same basic needs for support.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate people is to give them the experience of feeling understood.

">  the implications of likelihood that someone ""condoning"" suicidal ideation may be secretly inciting suicide. The cited sources help to create a potential inflated perception of this type of behavior. 

The suicide voyeurs and/or fetishists and whatever other labels might apply have had at least 15 subreddits that I personally know about banned by the admins that I know of.  Current the only one with significant traffic that's not banned is quarantined.  (I'm not going to name any of them.)  Some of our mods have infiltrated their communities and active suicide incitement and sabotage of our mission was definitely happening.  More subtle is the pro-suicide ""activism"" that co-opts language from other contexts to legitimise itself and normalises and encourages all sorts of toxic behaviours toward people at risk for suicide. 

It's much bigger issue than you might expect everywhere on the internet, but the anonymous, wide-open nature of reddit's design plus the (not entirely unjustified) reputation of reddit's management for being free speech extremists make it particularly bad here.  

These people's behaviour is blatantly criminal, but at the current state of our laws regarding online behaviour they're incredibly hard to stop. There are thousands of Melchert-Dinkels out there, but in his case there was a perfect storm of things going right from a detection and prosecution point of view.  

> My argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state.

I can support everything about that except the word ""condoning"".  It's one thing to respect someone's ownership of their life and their right to end it, and another thing to be content about it when someone is so miserable that it comes down to that.  It's always tragic when someone is brought the point of suicide - whether or not they follow through.  I don't think it's helpful or even excusable to be complacent about these situations.  But we need to deplore the circumstances and support the person.  

> Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement.

How could approval *not* be encouragement?  There's a vital (literally) difference between approval and acceptance, imnsho.  

> Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.

I don't think that's true in every context. Personally, I wouldn't even call myself anti-suicide.  I'm anti-suffering.  I marched in protests for a woman with ALS who was fighting for the right to die.  And as much as I am the first author of the anti-incitement wiki, I go even harder after the ""helpers"" who invalidate our OPs' feelings and experiences. But I think it's naive to assume that most of the pro-suicide advocacy in the case of despondent suicidalty is benevolent.  The internet has allowed the twisted souls who get off on pushing others over the edge to find each other, organise, and try to legitimise themselves."
"> I guess I forgot to say that I have helped multiple people from doing that (not on Reddit)

Much of the time, when people without relevant, specialised training intervene in ways that lead to good outcomes in the short term, they can leave people worse off in the long term due to things like encouraging outcome-based thinking (see point 4d in our guidelines).

Of course I can't know that that's the case with you, but there are many excellent reasons why we post so much material for our helpers to read.  A lot things that are commonly believed to be good things to say are actually terrible (see the top ten list of those linked from our talking tips post).   And a lot of things that can work some of the time have a high backfire rate.  

Even among people with years of training and experience, we never assume that we know what we're doing.  At my agency, even the most experience responders aren't allowed to ""solo"" on high-risk calls.  

Honestly one of the biggest red flags around here is someone who talks the way you are about their own abilities.  Most of the serious harm here is done by people who are well-meaning but ill-informed.  I can't know that you'll push someone over the edge through overconfidence, but please consider what I'm saying."
"> I do worry that formalization of accreditation or laying down overly stringent guidelines for volunteer helpers can be a mixed blessing. 

I think that's only a risk if the guidelines are made in ignorance of what works on crisis lines.  We teach rapport-building at a high level of skill at my agency, but we know, and stress in your training, that none of it will work if you aren't genuine.  Even though our responders have a framework (but definitely *not* a script) for their calls and have a few key protocols to follow, they need to be a genuine person connecting on a human level with the people they're helping.  

>  I don't know if ""cognitive load"" or burnout was a factor at the time I resorted to a helpline, and I don't want my criticism to seem harsher than it was. 

I think that a disengaged responder is one of the most legitimately serious criticisms you can make, so I don't think it's at all harsh to observe that that was your experience.  

> Maybe it's just that some people are naturally more empathetic than others,

Then they should have been screened out and not admitted into the training process

>  others may mean well and want to help but the gears don't always click smoothly

Then they either weren't properly trained, or they weren't self-aware enough to know that they needed a break (something else we explicitly teach).  

There's actually a lot of empirical information about how to give someone the experience of being truly heard and understood, and how to convey the empathy that we feel effectively.  Unless a caller is actively resisting the responder (that can happen for a variety of reasons) or not fully or honestly sharing what they're going through, every caller should get a positive experience, even if we can't fix or change anything in their lives."

"You may be correct. You're obviously more educated on the specific situation than I am.

As far as condoning and supporting the right to suicide, we'll seemingly just have to agree that we disagree... Because I've lost track of the argument there. I think there are plenty of good reasons to kill oneself. I think I have a pretty solid case myself. I still acknowledge that most cases are not good reasons to do it... But if a stranger is telling me they've come to that decision it would be offensive for me to assume they're in the wrong. I don't see another respectful way to approach it than to assume they're right from the get go and hope that they'll share with me what their reasoning is. It just seems offensive to enter a conversation with someone who just wants to share what's going on, with the intent to ""educate"" them or change their mind. I think we generally agree on the sentiment here and just maybe disagree on the application, which is fine.

It's not my subreddit and I'm not trying to be defiant or change the rules or anything.

The major point of all this was just that as someone who is going to commit suicide, I'm absolutely not interested at all in hearing about why I shouldn't from someone who knows nothing about me. But I'm happy to talk to someone who's not on some morality mission and is just interested in having a chat about it all.

I don't want anyone to kill themselves. I don't want anyone to die. I don't want anyone to suffer. But I'm not in charge, and don't know everything. All I know is if I can provide a listening ear without the subtext of hidden motivation, well that's likely the best I can do for someone. God knows if they need someone to try to talk them out of it, there's plenty of people already doing it that are probably for more qualified than me to do it."

Agree, the problem is that there are some people who feel righteously entitled to enjoy inciting suicide who are *extremely* active.

> As far as condoning and supporting the right to suicide, we'll seemingly just have to agree that we disagree... Because I've lost track of the argument there.

In my experience, that's usually an indicator that the differences are largely only semantic, which I've come to suspect as well.  

>  It just seems offensive to enter a conversation with someone who just wants to share what's going on, with the intent to ""educate"" them or change their mind.

Both those tactics, besides being morally reprehensible imo, are spectacularly ineffective in either easing suffering or reducing risk of suicide, so if someone's using they, they're the ones who need to be educated.  And we do our best with that, but sometimes it feels like an endless game of whack-a-mole.  There are a lot of pernicious misconceptions about suicide that just won't die. 

> The major point of all this was just that as someone who is going to commit suicide, I'm absolutely not interested at all in hearing about why I shouldn't from someone who knows nothing about me. But I'm happy to talk to someone who's not on some morality mission and is just interested in having a chat about it all.

I think you have an absolute right not to be lectured to or argued with.  And I have a responsibility to offer whatever comfort I can.  But don't you dare tell me that I don't have a right to be sad about the world losing someone as smart and insightful as you.  I think the ethical line to draw, though, is that it would be unfair for me to make my sadness your problem - and that's what far too many misguided ""helpers"" do.   My default starting hypothesis is that someone has become suicidal because the rest of humanity has comprehensively failed them.  Anyone who's interested in helping needs to in some way make up for that, not ask the person to do anything or suffer any more.  (Of course there are practical complexities, especially in the case of involuntary interventions, which I think are usually -- but not always -- a terrible idea.)  

I have especially intense hate for the mindset behind books like *Stay*, which was all the rage a few years ago.   Its operating assumption is that suicidal people have a responsibility to do a lot of difficult cognitive work to avoid ""damaging humanity"" by their deaths.  People who propagate that nonsense deserve to roast in the Hell in which I do not believe.  The real hell of it is that the suicide fetishists present themselves as a benevolent alternative."
We need more info.... duh.
"I know but it must be a little uncomfortable, no?"
"You do suggest that kind of things, check under ""Listen, empathise, and don’t judge"" in the examples. Not sure what you think about me but ""We suggest some real coginitive work"" sounds like you're telling me I am just a stupid person saying some sentences I read on reddit and dont care about the person. Idk man but talking to a suicidal person for 3 years, trying to help them, doing everything, spending hours, weeks, and thousands of dollars actually and you really think I dont put ""cognitive work"" into this? You dont fk know me or him and you're not the one to judge my effort. Anyway... You made clear that there's nothing else you can suggest or want to suggest, what ever."
Yeah its supposed to be a good thing to keep people happy. But he was never happy and I am afraid he never will. I will just keep holding hands until he's back on the boat :)
I guess...
I don’t think you even care because none of this stuff is moderated at all. People just come in here to feel better about themselves. They don’t care about suicidal people at all.
"I really like the way you put that. ""Making my sadness your problem."" 

I do honestly believe that a lot of people contemplating suicide are coming from a selfish place of *wanting* to inflict sadness. A vengeful suicide with the intention of making people feel bad about the way they treated them. But alternatively I think many people struggle with wanting to die for their own benefit but not wanting to hurt anyone in the process.

I'm very lucky to have shouldered the burden of being the one who experienced all the loss and finally being in a place where there's no one left to mourne my passing. Which to say, gets an instinctual reaction that is inaccurate. It's a very positive thing. I'm also fortunate to have had the time and collect the resources to be able to handle it in such a way that shouldn't so much as inconvenience anyone. Just disappear and never even have found remains for anyone to clean up. All goodbyes said. No mysteries or confusion. 

But that's incredibly difficult for most people to orchestrate and can be saddening. So that frustration with being bound by responsibility to not hurt people who likely contribute to your pain (whether intentional or not) can be overwhelming enough on a personal scale. Strangers piling on with guilt trips is just impossible to process.

Anyways I'm getting off topic here.

I appreciate being entertained in my confusion with the wording here and I think I have a better understanding now so thank you. I don't comment on many posts anyways but apologies in advance if I do in the future in a way that comes of to some as ""cold"" or even ""encouraging"". I'm only treating others the way I'd like to be treated, and only if I suspect it's how they'd also like to be treated."

"You may be doing a lot more, both cognitively and otherwise, than saying superficial, useless things like ""that must feel bad"", but the only information I have is what you've written here.  

After 3 years I can absolutely understand why you're at your wit's end.  Maybe you're just not able to understand this person - that happens to the best of us.  Maybe you're too frustrated at this point to empathise with them - we're all only human.  Or maybe they're choosing to stay stuck in a victim role and (consciously or not) making themselves impossible to help - that happens too sometimes.   Or maybe some degree of all of those things apply, and I'm sure there's a lot more to the situation that I don't yet know.  

If you'd like to share more details about the situation, I'd be glad to try and help, but maybe this thread isn't the best place for it  Please feel welcome to send it to our modmail."
"You're clearly becoming bitter and disillusioned and that's perfectly natural. But in that state you're not going to be helpful to a suicidal person. Read about [compassion fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_fatigue) if you haven't already.

I'd advise taking a break if its possible. It may not be depending on the circumstances of the suicidal person in your life.

Getting some counseling of your own may also help. Counseling can help just about anyone, not just people at the end of their rope. Just being able to vent in a safe environment can be very helpful."
"I'm sorry we got off to such a rotten start in our conversation (mostly my bad, I fear, for getting such a firm grip on the wrong end of the stick).  I hope you'll let us try and help.  In my IRL hotline gig, we deal with a lot of chronic users with years being stuck in more or less the same place, so we know only too well that it's not always easy, but we're glad to try."
Like a drug addict knows that what he does is stupid but he still can't just stop with it
"We do care, and believe me, we take down a lot of fatuous ""it gets better"" responses every single day. 

We're also hard at work on ways to provide more assertive direction and guidance to people who are trying to help.

You're absolutely right that some people come to communities like this to create an ego-gratifying ""helping experience"" *for themselves*.   We ban people like that frequently, but more always seem to crawl out of the woodwork."

Sure, but that doesn't mean that humanity didn't fail them.  A perceived need for revenge is usually an actual need for our pain to be recognised and understood.  

> So that frustration with being bound by responsibility to not hurt people who likely contribute to your pain (whether intentional or not) can be overwhelming enough on a personal scale. Strangers piling on with guilt trips is just impossible to process.

Yeah, that's what so stupid about the ""think of your loved ones"" brigade.  When other people have been nothing (or hardly anything) but a source of pain, it's cruel and counterproductive to be asked to  suffer more for their sake.

"This compassion Fatigue makes sense and sounds familiar a bit but I told myself I wont let him down. He tells me he knows that he's toxic, manipulative, that he makes people feel bad and sais its ok if I leave. But I dont believe that. Because what he sais directly is not what the messages say.

Counseling for me... Nah. I dont have the time. I was forced to see a therapist 15y ago. Took me a half year to find out if I can trust him and the day I decided yes, and told him whats really going on, the replied that 1. if I was kidding and 2. that you dont make jokes and laugh about this kind of things. Well I have an issue, the worse sth becomes, the more I laugh when talking about it but I cant help it, and it doesnt make me very trustworthy. So naaah, no therapists for me. Thanks for your effort.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.

Bravo. Get the personal agendas tfo. Trying to stand on the backs of suffering people to promote one’s own bs is downright shameful.
Understandable. This is more of a psychological group than a sociological one (if that makes sense).
"I am liking this place more and more all the time after reading the comments and the strict adherence to  the rules, (supportive etiquette).

Thank you !"
"how can people be supported if the context of their suicidality is almost always completely linked to their society and environment, and alienation? It's like taking a fish out of water to try understand it. we don't exist in a vacuum."
"Can someone point me to somewhere that does allow activism and discussion on mental health services reform.
Not here obviously but there has to be somewhere to talk about ways to improve suicide support."
Does this include religious preaching? Because people who are struggling often have people telling them to turn to God or whatever and I find it so rude. Idk if that's against the rules or not though.
Activism for depression and suicide is not allowed? Ok then......
"Forgive me if I’m out of line, but is it safe to post on here about being an attempted suicide survivor?"

"People are welcome to talk about their personal experiences, including societal and environmental factors.  It should be clear from even a glance at the front page that we're fine with that.  But supporting an individual is an entirely different process from supporting a cause.  Both are important, of course."
i agree. i dont really understand this rule in a fundamental way
"Unfortunately, /r/suicidology got banned because it got swarmed by the gang of suicide fetishists and voyeurs who were bitter about their explicit pro-suicide subs getting shut down.  I'm not aware of good alternatives on reddit."
"Proselytising isn't activism, but we have a different, specific rule against it.  

>  people who are struggling often have people telling them to turn to God or whatever and I find it so rude.

It's more than rude.  Exploiting someone's emotional crisis to try and recruit them into your religion is emotional abuse."
"We know that this policy is often surprising, but there's a full explanation in the body of the post."
It depends on why you're posting. It might break the role-modelling rule.
"That doesn't sound like activism, but it would break the rules about role-modelling and advocating for specific self-help strategies,"
"I absolutely agree, that's a poisonous way to try to ""support"" someone, but it has nothing to do with activism.  It is against our rules against generic ""uplifting"" messages and impossible promises."
"We absolutely agree that mental-health reform is badly needed in many parts of the world, and that means activism is needed.  But this is not the place to be raising awareness. For one thing, our population is all too well aware.

If you message the mod team with your location, we can try to help you find affordable local resources."
"Of course you're welcome to offer support in accordance with the rule and guidance we provide in the community info.  But if you reference offsite content that you have a personal association with it will be removed, and if you do it repeatedly you'll be banned.  

If you want to advertise, *pay for it*.  Reddit has lots of simple, affordable options for legitimate promotion."
"Usually.  Inappropriate, except as a peripheral aspect in the context of a request for interpersonal support."
"No, although advocating for specific treatments or self-help strategies breaks a different rule.   

From the body of the post:  ""fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support""."
You really shouldn't reply to a *moderator's* post about a community rule with your intention to break a different rule.
"Isn't caring a reason to stay, not leave?"
"As we (at least try to) make clear in the post, we agree passionately that activism is essential and that out there in the community more needs to happen.  Much more. 

But I can't imagine a place where raising awareness is *less* necessary than here."
"We're not tech support, but if you're using the official reddit app you need to be subscribed (i.e. join the sub) in order to post."
"Absolutely not.  There's a separate rule about proselytizing.

Exploiting someone's personal crisis to try to recruit them into your religion is emotional abuse and we treat it accordingly."
"???  It should be obvious from the content that the sole purpose of this sub is to talk about suicide.  But, as the body of this post makes clear, there's a huge difference between activism, and personal support."
[removed]
i guess the point im trying to make is that it doesnt address the root causes. what i understood by the rule is there is is no room for discussion for societal or say workplace patterns/cultures that are damaging to all their employees regardless of if they \_all\_ end up posting on this subreddit or not. what hope can we have for change in our personal circumstances if these factors can't be discussed under 'awareness'?
Gotcha. Thanks for the info.

See point 4b in the community info guidelines.
"There is no way you could make a post recommending your régime that wouldn't get you banned, so just don't.

We serve a vulnerable population. None of them are unnecessary.   If you're here as a helper, it's a lot easier to focus on what *is* allowed.  You may respond selectively to OPs you feel you can relate to, with individualised *emotional* support.  Nothing else."
But I cannot receive help if I cannot post. I am joined in the group but it will not allow me to post.
The most likely explanation is that you have subscribed to those other subs but not this one.

"Think of this as a hotline, not just a forum. The main focus is suicide prevention to its core. If responders receive calls about advertisements for alternate spirituality, how will they help the ones here who really need it."
I was considering making a post but given that my opinions and experiences with suicidality are so very much tied up with (in my instance) academic culture and i guess wider attitudes too that i figured it would just end up being an essay on the social attitudes that breed depression and/or suicidality which seemed to be against this rule

I wait till nightfall for a call from them but no one calls. So I do the only thing I can. I go into a park with a small pool, decently deep. I text my family ""years of pain and regret unleashed. As death and I finally meet."" I don't wait for a reply and jump into the pool without hesitation. I can't swim, so I drown and the cold waters makes my death faster but also more painful.

I know that feel bro/sis. I feel like I've reached a point beyond my parents' help and we have to make it alone.
I'm not saying religion is bs. And I respect those who by being religious it gives them strength and hope. But if I listen to what my mom says that God has a plan for me. Then it feels like his planning is having me suffer and kill myself.

I don’t go to church or anything, I just believe because it makes sense

Anyway nothing about that is irrelevant, I’m always told by my mother to ‘not worry because god will protect us’ when it makes no fucking sense, if I feel like killing myself I’ll do it, I can’t verbally talk to god and ask him to get rid of my problems, mental health is serious and is a massive killer 

Each day I cut myself to the point where I’m starting to think that there’s no way back now, I feel like I don’t want to live with this pain anymore, my mother hasn’t helped me at all she believes that I’m going to be okay. Load of bollocks, religious parents will only have theirselves to blame if their children commit suicide"

And sure, ignorance is bliss. But don't force it on other people, that's what the OP meant. Not everybody wants to devote a fourth of their lives being ignorant to the world, because yes, the world really does suck. And praying to marble, wood, some metal or wax, none of it is actually gonna help in any cause. If God is real, and he is selfish enough to only help people who kneel to him 24/7, fight in his name, and force all that on other people, then maybe he isn't the deity figure we assume him to be. If he's not that selfish, and treats everyone equally, well then why is one person sleeping with a heater on in their mansion and one is sleeping half naked on the roadside?

You guys blame Him for the suffering but you don't really try to become better humans. You still spread hate and you want the suffering to be gone? How could it be gone if we are that mean and bad?"
"This also seems to be their only reasoning for why God is bad. “Ay, well if god good, why bad thing happen????😠😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😠😠😠”"
You did say something bad
dont bring the churche’s priest into me
Don't bring church into my logic!
"Umm sorry but what from my comment gave you the idea I was a bad person? I go out of my way on a daily basis to make other people’s lives easier, I’m trying to study to become a scientist so I can help humanity by gaining more knowledge, I know you guys have a fetish for wanting to be oppressed but all I did was point out the flaws in your comment, you guys worship a god who sends people to be tortured forever just because they don’t believe in him and his fantasy book, I’m sorry but I can not stand by a god like that, hell I’d argue that not even awful people deserve that, you guys are so out of touch with reality because you can’t accept what death it’s insane, also you didn’t answer my question"
So babies who die in their first months of life are spreading hate too
">you guys blame Him for the suffering but you don't really try to become better humans

That's an ad hominem if I ever saw one"
"Is it not a valid question? If god is omnipotent and doesn’t find pleasure in our suffering, then why make us suffer?"
Don't church bring into my logic!
Don't logic bring into my church!
Don't church logic into my bring!
Don't into bring church my logic!
Don't church into my bring logic!
"It's funny, we're all just suicidal people telling other suicidal people that suicide isn't the answer."
Some of us manage to hold on more than others.
"I agree to this to an extent. I'm also fascinated with how some people genuinely believe they've never been there, or being so neive to not realize they might be at the breaking point. If not, whats the outlet? I also find it quite comical over people I've known threatening to do such, and now years later they deny it to the throat. I see your point sir."
I'll never say that suicide isn't the answer.
It is the answer tho which is the ironic part
I'm not suicidal.
Then this doesn’t apply to you
"I started school as a ""gifted"" kid. I ended by failing out of college twice with a 1.0 GPA"
"You aren’t a coward at all, you are in pain"
"I have ADHD and I'm an alcoholic.  I made it to my late 20's before I ruined everything.  Now, I'm a 44 year old unemployed alcoholic a step away from being homeless.   I share your misery my friend."
I can sympathize. But I want to counsel you that college isn’t worth shit. Your life is worth much more than some college degree. People still care about you and appreciate you even if it is some friends on the internet chatting
Some of the best art is made when you are low. Channel it and leave it on the page. Draw a panel about how you are feeling each day. This may help. You are enough today. And you will be tomorrow too.
"A piece of paper isn’t a measure of your self worth. You’re a smart person, you just find it hard to apply all of that in things like schoolwork due to mental illness. You’re not stupid and you’re not useless, that’s for sure"
Guys I dint know how reddit works but I really need help
i’m literally in the exact same position. social anxiety mostly has ruined my life. i can draw but other than that i really serve no purpose. i even barely do art as it is because i don’t see the point  i figure i should have ended it a long time ago but i guess i’m still here.
"I was feeling this way, please try ketamine or other options to help before you attempt something drastic"
I’m a parasite I should die
"I feel this on a different level, I have ruined every friendship with friends, my relationship with my girlfriend. I have wasted so much of my dads money and time, lied, stole from him. I am a terrible student who just wastes money at college because I want to fit a mold of society that I don’t even know makes sense. And on top of all of that I might have gotten herpes.. I’m going to kill myself soon but I hope you don’t, just think it always could be worse"
The way I think about it is you only get one life. Eventually we all die. You could look at it in a way where that could be sped up. Or you could look at it in a way where you might as well play it through. In the grand scheme it doesn’t really matter either way. So why not live it through and do your best.
Dude don’t hurt yourself until you see how the people around you feel about you and how they care about you
It could be worse you’re right but it’s already shitty
"I want to clarify my point. We get one life. So just do your best to improve your situation and live your life. In the end, we all turn into dust and that’s that. So why not just live the one life we have. I hope that helps you. If it’s irrelevant or misses the point I’m sorry. It just helped me personally. I hope it helps you."
People shouldn’t care about me I’m horrible
Yea I can’t tell you it will get better because for me it hasn’t and it is about to get worse. I’ll know by tomorrow whether I’m going to go through it or chicken out again
Shooting myself tonight
Hey do you wanna talk?? I’m in a similar headspace right now and I’d love to chat with someone who understands
Please know that I care about you
if you don't end up doing this PLEASE for heavens sake let us know
"well shit, that was a very strict time limit... I hope you're ok mate"
please…don’t :(
"Man, I know the feeling but could you just hold on a little longer? Who the hell knows what tomorrow may bring. I have hope for us both."
We still care about your safety and want the best for you so please don’t do anything irrational
Your safety is important to me and people in your own life still cares about you
"Please don’t. I’m sad too, but feel like you are important. I’m so sorry you feel this way"
I killed myself
I think I needed that. Thanks.
Sad my guy.
Damn words hurt but the man did this help
Thank you for this.
Ever been so depressed that you avoid mirrors because you hate the person you see
For some reason when I wear glasses I can never look in the mirror. It increases my self loathing by x2 for some reason.
Yes I’ve moved my bed away from my mirror because of it. I also used to practice dancing a lot and i don’t anymore.
"I feel like this, i dont like to look at me and see each time the shit i've become in, it really sucks, everytime i look myself at the mirror i only see all my problems right there"
Haha I don't keep a mirror in my room for this very reason
Every day. Either that or I obsess in front of.it trying to fix things and end up feeling worse. So I just stay away.
"Me me me 

The past 2 weeks have been awful to me. I have been constantly eating, not taking care of myself, sleeping 10 hours a day. Idk what happened or why am I going through this phase but it sucks man."
yes all the time actually.
"Yup, have you ever been so depressed and dissociated that you didn’t even recognize the person in the mirror was even you?"
"Yeah. I've also found myself feeling ashamed when I smile and immediately stop it, even if it's just at a joke on my phone or something."
Did that last night when I didn’t want to see myself cry
Yup. Just me the other day. Self hate is real
I do that because I am balding and it sucks to look at my hair.............  :-/
"Yes, whenever I look at myself, it triggers my unworthy presence..."
"I havent looked in one in about 2-3months. Or looked at videos of myself. Or anything that reveals my appearance to myself.

Longest I've done this for was about 6-7 months and st that point I just stopped seeing ""myself"" when I *did* look at that again."
"Never had a problem with looking at my face in the mirror but I hate it when I see my body in it. I don’t really care about how ppl look or if they are skinny or fat. But I just hate my body, it feels like a meat suit that is not me but I am trapped inside."
"When I look in a mirror, it’s either to try to get rid of imperfections or to talk to myself. To try and figure something out. I don’t hate myself because I’ve never intentionally hurt anyone. Sure, I’ve made plenty of mistakes, and I’ve hurt people unintentionally, but why should I hold myself to a higher standard than everyone else?"
"""Mirrors are fun. I like to play a game where i look into a mirror until i stop seeing a person being reflected in it."""
yes this is me. i can barely look people in the eyes half the time bc im that self-conscious
"Lowkey I envy my reflection in the mirror, when I step out he dissapears till next time, without having to endure the time between glances."
"40 year old here. I have a beard that goes down to my belly. Havent cut or trimmed since 2020 covid. Cant stand to see myself in the mirror... bums me the fuck out that I am this fat and ugly and the wife has given up as well trying to get me to the barber. We have this massive mirror in our bathroom to our walk in shower and I exit and enter that shower backwards to not even see my shape or a glimpse.

Thing is, I have always disliked my body and face - and up until I met my wife I thought it was natural. which is why i cant stand these semi naked streamers and ""influencers"" on social media.

TMI but hey its reddit :)"
I legit do everything in the dark so I cant see my body and all the things I hate about it.
Yes lol
all the time
"yep. makes me hate my skin and body. I feel like I belong in another body, like this one isn't good enough. As if I should change genders"
I have a big mirror in the hallway and that's it. I look to the side or take off my glasses when I pass there. And I put all the little mirrors away. But sometimes I see a reflection in the phone and just... terrified.
"yes, unfortunately"
For the past 4 years... Every. Single. Day!!!
"Yes, I was like this for the longest time. Really happy I, I guess, grew out of it a few years ago. Completely terrifying anytime I was in public and there would be any kind of reflective surface around. Stay strong."
"I’ve been using the bathroom (using like whatever - from going to pee, to taking a bath) without turning lights on for two years because I hated my face so much. I freaked out when I saw myself one day."
"Always and I feel like that for years now. I just hate who is looking back at me, can't find a feature on me I don't hate. But the worst part will always be the deeply hurt eyes, staring at me in immense disappointment for whom I have become."
Yup I feel that! Going through that rn
"When I was in my late teens, some classmates came to my place and saw some old photos of me my mum hung up around the house. 

One of them said to me, ""Damn, you used to be pretty! ...What happened to you?"" in a genuinely concerned tone. 

I've always had sensitive skin and was going through a bad acne outbreak back then. And I was already unconfident and had low self esteem. After he said that I couldn't bear to look at myself in the mirror for the longest time ever cos I thought I was really ugly. 

Now, looking back (I'm 29 now), I should've slapped that dude. And I wasn't even that ugly, even with the acne. 🙄 He's no brad pitt either even without acne."
"Hello, I don't know why I am unable to post but please I require help. I want to die so badly!"
"Absolutely. I have 1 mirror in the bathroom. I only use it for brushing my hair and the occasional shave, I hate walking by reflective glass on the street. The only plus of this pandemic is that I can hide most of my face, If I look into someone's eyes in passing I keep thinking they look at me with disgust. I'm only alive because of my kids, and not wanting to hurt them if I took my life."
"Yeah definitely, I'm looking at a failure"
Yep. I always change clothes and shower in the dark.
Me every day
"Yeah, that's why I avoid mirrors. On days where I've barely seen myself in the mirror, I notice I'm less sad."
"I got gender dysphoria so yeah. I hate my smile too,"
I swapped rooms with one of my siblings last year and there’s a mirror nailed to the door. I have to keep it open so it’s against the wall. But then I feel uncomfortable because my doors open.
I didn't know other people do that. I'm in that state right now
Every single day of my life
"imagine being in public spaces, groceries and everywhere in the city that you can spot a  mirror and seeing yourself just makes me wanna puke 'oh look at ya! you're that weird girl' even the way I stand thereee"
That happens when you become a single mother
yeah I havent looked in a mirror in months and months...
Pff I used to have times when I looked in the mirror and started crying because I didn't recognize myself
I don't mind looking at myself from a distance it's the close ups that haunt me 😫
"This. Also I recently had a horrible dissociative panic attack that started while I was looking in the mirror, where I didn't recognize my reflection as a voice in my head was telling me that I will push away everyone I hold close to me."
This is me right now I haven’t been able to look at myself in the mirror for more than a minute for a couple months now
"No, I’m lovely."
multiple times
"Was my situation in 2018, I am. Better now but still traces left"
"Hi... is there a chance that you're questioning your gender? A lot of trans people tend to do this, in addition to not taking care of their bodies or wearing pajamas every day. Might want to think about specifically \*why\* you don't like your reflection."
Yes. I covered up mine last night and blacked out any pictures of me on my phone
"going through that right now. I've been depressed since last year, gained a ton lot of weight I don't even recognize myself. Let alone use the clothes that I used to love. Nothing fits me anymore. I used to have my hair dyed with colors, now it's just a mess. I don't have a job atm so buying new clothes or taking care of my hair in a proper way is not an option. I started therapy a month ago. It's the only thing that keeps me hopeful, but there are some days I stay away from mirrors because i just can't deal with that."
Yes. I brush my teeth with my eyes closed or in another room so i don’t see my reflection for more than a couple seconds.
Been there
YES. I have psoriasis right on my face and scalp. Its DISGUSTING...
I stare at the mirror till I love myself. If it takes an hour then so be it we ain’t leaving till we love ourselves. I know it’s easier said than done but please try it once for a stranger on Reddit who believes in you.
not really no
I’m starting to feel this way more every day of my life
[removed]
"same, i stopped wearing my glasses three years ago because they made me that fucking ugly"
What kind of dancing did you used to do
"Ye. I don't have photos of myself on my phone or my Instagram, when people ask me why I just say I'm not photogenic. Which is just a polite way of saying I hate myself."
"I go through cycles like this. It helps me to know that it won't last forever, even though it seems like it will in the moment."
"Yeah, that happens to me a lot. I've only been starting to dissociate more recently. It happens when I look at some of my family members too, like I can't believe I share a life with them. It's weird and don't know that causes it."
"There's been times when I walk past a car and see my reflection, and it startles me that I look the way I do because I try so hard to avoid seeing myself"
Do you think that has had a positive or negative effect on your self-esteem?
Used to take boiling hot showers just to fog up the mirror so I can't see. Now I just don't shower.
Ye I freak out everytime I get a glimpse of myself passing a window or a car. Always just feels like that dude I see isn't supposed to be there.
Didn't know either until I read the comments on this post
I always feel dissociated from my body when I catch a glimpse of myself in public. Like idk who that dude is but he shouldn't exist.
You won the genetic lottery I see. Either that or you still can love yourself. I respect that.
"It's not so much my gender. It's more so I'm brown and hate it because of all the racism I've felt. Have bad acne and have had people say they are uncomfortable looking at me because they feel grossed out. I used to be into fitness and worked out but that changed with lockdown and depression, so I miss the way I used to look. Also everytime I see myself it's a constant reminder of the mistakes I've made and the people I hurt and continue to hurt."
"> stare at the mirror till I love myself. If it takes an hour then so be it we ain’t leaving till we love ourselves. I know it’s easier said than do

I try to stare at myself and smile after I brush my teeth, like I'm in a toothpaste commercial. Sounds cheesy but it always helps boost my mood."
Yup
Default and orange justice
"Mate, after a long time today, I feel a bit like myself."
"Yeah, it’s a long road back to living. That’s the thing about it, you are more watching your life pass by then actually living it at that point."
"Both.

I hate myself, and progressively hate it even more.

I progressively feel less and less like myself."
"My advice: being hard on yourself for things that don’t matter won’t do anything. Do a mental exercise and picture yourself looking how you want/dreamed. How does the admiration from flakey, vapid people really improve quality of life? They’re the biggest losers with problems they hide. They can’t approve or disprove of me. Their standards they judge you by is the only currency they have for their own shitty worth, that’s why it “matters” to begin with."
It does! Our standards on beauty are so warped by media that we have to reset it. There’s so much beauty in the face of a fighter and I’ll be damned if no one here is a fighter!
It's not so much being sad when I compare myself to others. It's more so depressed cause I've fucked not only my future but also the lives of others around me. And it's hard to try and forgive myself when I keep doing it.
"It's not so much I'm uncomfortable with the fact I'm not pretty. I've always just been ugly or average and been ok with it. I used to be fit but depression and lockdown changed that, so I do hate myself for that. It's more so that when I look at myself all I feel is pain from my past, and it's a reminder that I am a shitty person that somehow continues to hurt the people around me."
"Can you forgive your future self who hasn’t done anything yet and can change? Are other people completely perfect? I don’t know what your philosophical views are on the meaning/purpose of life, but I’d say you learned the lessons you were put here to experience and have worked out of you. Be the person you approve of moving forward. If others can’t forgive you when you’ve become genuine, that’s they’re personal lesson they were put here to get over. Life is a game...I just gave you the answers to the test."
"Imma be blunt but it's hard when your responsible for someone's death, it's hard when you've cause people the have heart attacks because of you that still affect them today, it's also hard when people want to have a future with you but can't because of your depression and failing  life like school"
Did that happen tomorrow?
Human beings are the most disgusting creatures on the face of the Earth
That is absolutely horrible. Honestly I somewhat desire to keep living but human beings like that make me question the point of if I should keep going or not. At the end of the day we all end up the same way. Dead. So it makes so sense while we are living that status is even a thing in the first place. This world is so fucked up..
I’m really sorry. People can be disgusting.
"You need to believe me when I say this, but as much our society is filled with fucked up and downright evil people, there are still good people who don't tolerate this kind of behavior. The fact that you felt that way while your boss was stepping over you and your colleagues tells me   alot about the kind of person you are."
"I wish I could disagree, and tell you about all of the wonderful things humans have done. Maybe once upon a time I could've talked about that and actually believed what I would be saying, but now, I'd just be lying.  


But we're all doomed anyways. The extinction of humans will probably come by our own hands."
I’m mentally preparing myself each day to kill Myself
[removed]
"I've been preparing for years.  
Just hoping I die naturally before I have to do it myself."
"is it something you want to do, or is it just something you feel fated to do?"
But we can make it better at some point idk what your going through but if u needed to share ill be here
"It’s painful to have these intrusive thoughts every day isn’t it? I go to sleep every night wishing that I don’t wake up. I have all of my affairs in order and now just in a holding pattern.

Just wanted to say hi and and that you’re not alone in these feelings"
"Being stuck with my family while I have suicide intentions is hard, that's why I mentally prepare so when I get to be independent one day, I might do it in a place nobody will know"
Each slash is bigger everyday until I finally do it
I've been preparing myself for the past few months but never done it yet.
Me too. I’m worthless at this point.
Why?
Same
Felt this
Same
Wanna talk about it? We’re here to listen
Me too pal. Me too
Hey no you deserve a good life
Sending support
"hey, i don’t know anything about you, but if you are serious about this, get help from families and friends. I will be praying for you :)"
this. every time I get in my car I’m hoping it will be the time someone finally hits me hard enough to kill me. that way at least my family won’t hate me
yea:/
I think fate
[removed]
You know nothing
Same. Make it hard and make it instant.
"That is true, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't wish and hope for a better life. Sometimes that hope is the only thing that keeps some of us going."
Then you must be disappointed often
I wish I could read what will happen after I kill myself
I just assume nobody will care
"It wrecks a family. It wrecked my family when my son completed. Blame is inevitable and chasms of hate appear. His best friend ended up in inpatient care. A family member ended up in inpatient care. Jobs were lost due to stress. Health issues happen because grief is just stress wrapped in despair. 

Eventually all the well wishers disappeared. It took about a month for the last card to arrive. No one talks about him with me. No one calls or texts. If I call I get sent to voice mail, if I text someone the most I get is a care emoji because no one knows what to say to the mother of the kid that killed himself. I just want them to say his name, to tell me a memory, and hope it’s one I haven’t heard yet. It’s as close as a future with him that I have. But instead I get care, hugs, thoughts and prayers. 

Life will move on. Tears will dry up. But not with the people who knew you, who loved you, even if they only loved you for a moment. For those people, calendar moves but they are stuck on day one. It’s always day one."
The only reason I’m alive right now is because I know my friends and family would devastated.
"School will probably have an announcement and maybe throw a dumb ass assembly regarding the evils of suicide and the internet and shit like that, completely ignoring the fact that my peers' indifference, rejection and scorn is what pushed me to spend hours at a time online, all the while assholes I barely/never knew talk about all the ""good memories"" they had with me."
"Unless your school doesn’t give a fuck about you, and no one ever noticed you had left."
"Yeah, I don't think any students would notice my absence even months after the fact, but administration usually makes a fuss about a student death."
Suicide is the only thing that gives me hope
I am 16 and  wish to die to just looking for the right way
Yep.  I'm unemployable because I fucked up my life with alcoholism.  I'm happy to just end it.
We should do a mass suicide together
"I’m 21 and have felt this since i was 8. 
Not sure these feelings are going to ever completely go away"
Me to thinking of jumping from high cliff or something
tonight
"hey. hey. i wish i could tell you everything was going to be ok. i wish i could tell you everything works out. but if i told you that i would be lying, and i’m sure you’ve heard enough of all that bulkshit to know it doesn’t help. 

but please. stay for tonight. just tonight. just one more night at least. stay. talk to me, if you like. i know the nights can be lonely and it’s good to have someone help you through the difficult ones. 

please bro. if you’re reading this, please please please just take a breather and just stay a while."
"You are not a burden. Your worth is not determined by your productivity, your grades, your relationships, etc. We aren’t here on Earth to work or be perfect. We are just here to live. Please stick around for tonight."
What makes you think you’re a burden?
Peace be the journey brother. Hope things work out for the best for you either direction.
I'm glad I had my dog with me.
Too bad! Take my upvote. And stay strong man 💪🏼 glad your furry boy is looking out for you.
Too bad pets are not allowed in my house anymore
"I don’t wanna make my pet upset for what I wanna do, it would be better if we never ever meet and love each other"
The unconditional love of my dog has helped in some very low times. She is one of my only anchors right now.
"Thank you, bro. I needed this post.  I love you, man. Blessings to anyone else who's reading this."
My mom hates pets.
"I got a knife on my table...It shines so brightly at times while doing homework due to the sun coming out...It has been grey here in Germany since lockdown...Oh,so grey...I made some praperation for a little project I have for my best friend...A letter. It is not a suicide note,I could not bear breaking my promise...I tried it,but broke down after two sentences. His words brought me to tears...He said I should learn to love myself,because I am quiet a good guy and a very good friend. No one ever told me that...I was always a bother or disgrace,if I was not of use to them. Writing the note: ,,Well,this is the end for me as it seems. I am not going into deatail as to why because you already know why...I am just sorry for having bothered you for so long"" *the thing he said comes to my mind* I want to write on and be done with it,but...I begin to shake.I try to write a I,but the line does not get straight...I think about his words again...I try to push them down,to tell myself he didn`t mean it,that it would be best to stop bothering him with my worthless existence,but deep down I know that he meant it. I throw away my dip pen and the rare brown ink...it spills the paper.I go back to bed...still thinking,still shaking....the tears start coming while lying on my pillow and I just say...,,I am sorry that I tried to break my promise...I am sorry."" and cry until I fall asleep."
"I wish I had never gotten my dogs. Either my life would be completely different, or I'd be free to end it."

Today I saw the aftermath of what could happen if I committed suicide
"When the time feels right, I think talking to your family about your feels would help. 
I had a friend who commit suicide and his sister, who also had those thoughts, saw what happens after. Sure she still has those thoughts because mental illness goes on, but she at least now knows what would happen after. 
It was a weird silver lining for my friends family. 

Tough talk happen all the time but if you get too down and out again where it crosses your mind reaching out to your family or friends is a good thing.
It can be hard if your family doesn’t take it seriously but after a death in the family they may just."
">I feel like a huge hypocrite because not too long ago I wanted to die.

Think about things this way: if you had a leg injury and you decided to drop out of a marathon because of it, would people blame you? Of course not! Your leg injury clearly is a big deal and problem for you.

Likewise, your depression is an illness that prevents you from being your best. This is ZERO chance you could have known that this was going to happen and you can't blame yourself. Take this as a wake up call though."
"Depression is an ugly beast. It'll subside for a while but it seems to always come back once it has you. Your mom is right to a degree, you do need to be strong, but you also need to talk about it. The fact that she won't talk about it is wrong. I'm glad you are thinking about how your family will react if you killed yourself but don't let that guilt you into living. Live for you. You can be happy even in the worst of times; you need to figure out what works for you."
"Don’t feel guilty. Depression is a sickness, you can’t help the emotions you feel. I’m sorry about your uncle, and I’m sorry that your family can’t come to terms with the facts. Sending love"
"Crying before I sleep, I didn’t do it today but it will happen inevitably. I feel like my life is one sick fucking joke."
"I understand. I’ve been there. 13 years ago I had it all planned out in detail. But, I’m still here. How old are you?"
"I should be able to go through with it, and I don’t know why I keep failing. I’m 17"
"There is so much more life. So, so much more. So many years of TV shows, and books, and movies, and jobs, and friends, and acquaintances, and learning.  I’m 38 now, and nothing is perfect. But it’s easier. And with each year that passes I’m more content than I was the year before. Please don’t give up. The future has endless possibility."
Why do I fuck up everything
"Sounds like you could use a little THC in your life my friend. We all fuck up. I for sure fuck up all the time haha. It's OK though, it's called being HUMAN. Sometimes we gotta take a step back and appreciate what we have BEFORE it's gone, don't dwell on things that are in the past. I know this is all pretty cliche advise, but we all need to hear it sometimes: everything is OK. Nobody can ride the high wave all the time NOBODY, if they say they do their either liars or in denial. The true trick to happiness growing up is appreciating the lows as well. We need some contrast in our emotions to appreciate the highs. Remember, the little things in life and practice random acts of kindness. One love 👊"
"Its a self-destructive loop, i get it. But that does not mean by any standards youre a fuckup"
I feel the exact same way right now
No it doesn't get better
It gets progressively worse for me.
"6 years passed,and nothing for me!
Everything's horrible as usual.Maybe even worse because now I can see it."
"My life situation seems to be getting better but I'm convinced that one day it will just crash and burn.

My mental health on the other hand, hasn't really changed for the last 5-6 years."
"So here is the thing about getting better with time. It wont just getter, no, you have to work for it. You need to find something that brings you joy or atleast occupies your body and mind so you don't have to think about stuff. Also checked your posts and being a virgin at one point stops being a big deal. I think after like the age 18 no one else other then you wont care about your sexual history"
"I hate it too when strangers say things they don't really mean ""I love you don't off yourself"" and then disappear forever minutes later hahahaha that's so effective I feel so loved now my life is complete ;)

Jokes aside, it *can* get better. Luck is far from reliable so some of us have to work our butt off to get what others were gifted since birth and often take for granted. Things like a loving family, a support system, true friends, good looks or a functioning body and a healthy mind. No one is born equal. Life isn't the same for all of us, we're all unique with our own circumstances, opinions, desires and personalities. If you're not like the majority, you're screwed - not a concept hard to understand. You want to be accepted, loved, and to belong.. that's not asking too much. It's completely normal to want those things, so good job reaching out! I have a question. Everything you yearn, everything you're robbed out of life, everything you're deprived of, are you ready to provide that for someone else? Would you be there for someone else,.. hypothetically, someone like you?

Because trust me, there are a lot of people who are able to empathise with your situation on a personal level. A lot of people who need exactly what you need. And coincidentally, it is the ones who are starved of love that appreciate it the most. I always felt all alone and actually been for the greater portion of my life. But reading there are others suffering just like me with their own sets of problems made me realise that this isn't some sick hell designed specifically to torture me - or so it seems. And more importantly, I finally woke up to the fact that I had been giving my attention and compassion to people who already have abundance, who don't need it, who don't appreciate it. I know what pain tastes like and I wish I was here sooner to support others like myself. Hey, I'm here if you wanna talk."
"If you say so. 
And the virgin thing... ppl care. Hence a whole subreddit about it"
"i was a virgin until 22. i slept with more girls than i could even remember by like 32. 50+ easy, and i wasnt even trying to be a ho. 

now nearing 40 I changed my philosophy again and wish i hadnt of slept with all of those girls and instead had settled for one that was nice, smart, sweet. 

be patient. it isn't time yet. and basically, we are stupider when we are younger, so please be patient."
"I was a virgin until I was 18. None of my friend were. I was full of hate and saddness. What did I not have? Why did none of girls go for me? Now I'm a month shy of being 24, I know that I am a lot less good looking to accident at work, girls still don't like me and I don't care. There is a subbreddit for everything"
Must be nice
Ok
"I was also an 18 y.o. Virgin, it’s not uncommon at all! Since I have been with 10 gals. Have patience."
I am 24 virgin. So.
At age 24 I’d only been with two girls one time each
Ah ok
I have entirely failed in life and I see no future for myself anymore. The only thing that is holding me back are my parents
my God i cant remember being happy in the last 2.5 years. and you have parents that care and want to help. please make the most of it. grow and help others. good luck.
I love you ❤️
"Same, I'm still holding on cause I know that if I do it, my parents and other family members wouldn't handle it, they are my everything and I will hold on for them"
"Hey, I don't really want to contradict you, but your life is not only suffering. You said yourself that at times you're happy and laugh, and you also have your family by your side. 
Might be a stupid advice, but did you try focusing on those small things that make you happy and laugh? Making it happen as much as possible?"
"I ruined my life with alcoholism.   Lost everything.  I mean literally everything.  Can't get a job anywhere.  I raise way to many red flags in a background check.  44, single,  unemployed bankrupt.  I am a huge suicide risk.  My elderly father won't be around much longer so I will at wait until after he dies before I go ahead with suicide."
"Same thing. I really can't live with these ups and downs anymore. I am also so tired of having to live providing to get acceptance of others, I've never been accepted by anyone for doing the things that I like or that I'm not good enough at. All the other things I just do because people expect me to do it, I really can't live this way anymore, it needs to stop somehow but there seems to be no in between."
Parents aren’t the only people to care about you. Everyone in this subreddit cares and wants to help. I sincerely care about your personal safety and happiness.
"I hear you pal. There is always hope though, and you really never know if/when things may turn around. Might as well at least wait to see the day for a while."
I care and so does every one else on this subreddit
Please don’t hurt yourself. I care about you and your plight
"Help, i don't know what to do"
You should try to get him to seek professional help and if he's not willing keep an eye on him and be ready to potentially contact emergency services if hes in danger
He don't want to. His parents ae comparing him to others a lot and I can't do anything about it
Have you told his parents?
I think they wouldn't listen cause they don't care. They want him out of the house during pandemic.
I dont even want my life to get better I just want it to end
"Wow, I wrote the exact same thing in my notebook this morning"
fucking same... just over life period.
"I feel exactly the same way. I am exhausted of having to work for a ""dream"" life and not getting any results. I think I just realized that I don't want that at all, that I just want to enjoy life with nothing or just die. I realized what is considered to be a dream life is based around how people perceive me and not what I actually enjoy, it feels more like the dream life is more like some kind of fantasy than a reality that I find getting up early out of bed for. I feel like my life so far has just been a vague hallucination based on whatever I was dreaming about at the time."
weeeirdd 👀👀
i'm just tired
im so so tired too
"Try microdosing mushrooms. Helped me figure my urges out quick, wasn't easy to change em and I get thoughts but it's easier to appreciate more than what I did. Plus someone could need you as much as you need them. Good vibes man."
"it isn't fair that so many people feel like this. it used to comfort me to not feel so alone, but it's gotten to the point where it's like...why do we all have to go through this. it isn't fair."
"thank you for the advice, i'll try to do some research on this. glad you found something. love & light to you, friend"
"it isnt fair at all. why did so many of us get dealt a shitty hand. we didnt do anything to deserve this.
oh well, im leaving this earth pretty soon anyway. i hope u stay around. i know its hypocritical of me"
"i wish you would stay. i wish we would both stay and realize we were being ""silly"" but i know how much it hurts. here if you need anything but i'm sorry we feel we are out of options. all love to you. i'm sorry."
physical pain makes me forget about my suicidal thoughts
Now you get it. But please don't try to start cutting if possible. Not an easy addiction.
"If you ever find yourself seeking pain, instead of hurting yourself seriously use rubber bands on your wrists. The pain is sharp and you can control it very well, but it won't really hurt your wrist in any serious way."
was clean for 24 days.. relapsed yesterday
"I'm clean for about a month, it's hard not to relapse"
"I have sporadic episodes where I think about cutting and I do it from time to time, but i find that pinching yourself really hard gives a mild version of the same feeling. Scars are harder to explain."
I’ve fallen out of love with life
"I know exactly what you mean, but I'm 10 years younger than you. This world is fucking insane, I hate that I had to be born at the time in history that I was. Modernity has robbed me of anything that has actual value. I want to just lay on the forest floor until the Earth swallows me."
"Go somewhere where you're happy yo. I'm trying my ass off to get back to AZ, I'm stuck in KY. I know no one here and my girl of 5 years, my best friend dipped for Texas one random day off we shared. Left me with our cats and an apartment she knew damn well I couldn't afford alone. Boy, I went down hard. It was non stop bars acid and lean for 3 weeks. I was low key tryna die. This is where our situation will differ. I have an 8 yo son who I haven't seen since he was 4 months. Bad terms with the mom, Wisconsin to Arizona yadayadayada. Anyway she randomly tells me he wants to talk to me, she had never said one bad thing about me despite how much shit she'd say to me. And that kid knew who I was and was so thrilled to talk to me. Fucking changed everything dude, my boy threw the rules out the window. My point, someone needs you. Maybe not immediately but I promise, and it's gonna slap you in the face and you'll be thankful."
Humanity went totally wrong.
" I don't usually answer, but I identify with this post immensely. I am 30 years old, and since March last year I have been through the same. more and more basic values ​​of humanity are being lost, which leads us to question certain concerns. a led world that venerates false and narcissistic stars, in which we distinguish merit for money more and more. It's sad.   
 Anyway, being more of a ""devil's advocate"", I like to put things differently too. As we know, more and more people appear to be something they are not, and social networks are very good at it: in demonstrating happiness or success when it does not exist, therefore, those kids who all grew up with everything they wanted, may not currently have what they want, they are also having problems with their head as we have."
"I hear you man. Sometimes people like you (who suffer alot) are not understood. People tire of ""the whining"" of the hurt and prefer to think on other things--usually because they are busy trying to get comfortable themselves. 

Some people are privileged and some are not, and some people who appear privileged suffer greatly, having a warm space and food to eat is not privilege, if you don't have you should. 

I wish you a supportive community and good travels on your mental health journey."
"We ARE indeed in hell .
The only solution i found is live by brcoming the People strong and influent enough to change it ?"
"I feel the same, sending you all the best"
"It’s so much easier to live life being a selfish person. Unfortunately my first love was this type of person, and it sent me in a downward spiral I’m still struggling to recover from."
Exactly! You’ve just read my mind.
Give DMT a shot before u go
Joe rogan is that you
"It really changed my perspective. It made me want to fight for my life and live to see my potential. Went well for a few months, I turned my life around way too fast and couldn’t handle it. I’ll definitely do it again, however this time I’ll take my changed perspective with a grain of salt."
Terrible person
That's how I feel too
about to shoot myself
"Please don't! There is a way out from the suffering without taking such measures. I promise you. I am going through similar things, but I can still enjoy life. I have my bad days, but ultimately I have found peace through philosophy. You can too, you just need to expose yourself to it. Our perspectives have so much power over us. It doesn't have to be this way."
Life is so worth living and I still care about you please just talk to us
People still care even if it is just some friends on the internet
please tell me you’re still with me
I love you
No it does not get better
"Maybe its fucking stupid but im even trying ""nofap"" now. I still feel like piece of shit but new thing is i constantly feel this pressure in my pants. Fucking amazing"
"They said it because you believed it for a while, or at least entertained its possibility. It worked on you. That's why they said it. They don't care that it was a lie. If most people could keep you alive with lies for 50 years, they would consider themselves a hero.

I'm saying this because I'm similarly frustrated, not because I have an answer."
[deleted]
This one is about me not about them. If i had someone who realy loved me i would not be here now
[deleted]
"You dont need to apologize. I know you didnt mean to do or say anything wrong. Its good you share this story.

I tried to find someone who will love me. Already wrote about it. Im really tired. I dont have strenght anymore. Ive reached my breaking point"
I wish i was normal
I’m deeply sorry that you were violated. People who do that are sick and twisted. But don’t give those fuck faces control of your happiness. It’s not your fault.
i disgust myself
"I can’t pretend to know what you’re going through but I know a bit about what you feel. At times I’ve been insecure about my voice, my body. I could afford to lose a little weight, and when I hear my voice on a recording I wince a bit. But I surround myself with people who are proud of me and love me and I love myself. I know it’s simple but it’s not as easy as that, I know. You’re worth it"
hang in there bud. find something to get invested in. having obsessions and inspirations helps you forget about this reality for a bit and also givea you more things to look foward too in life even when you're miserable. it could be as simple as a great series or a band you really like or moments when you're sitting at an open window watching heavy rain while drinking your favorite beverage. anything x
I was raped and for over a year I thought I was all my fault. I am now extremely depressed and want to sucide. I can't live with this anymore
"The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that, if I kill myself, they win. They wanted to control my body. They wanted to control my will. I’m fighting with everything I have to keep them from taking that away from me again. They may have won years ago, but they won’t win now."
"Please reach out and seek help, you deserve to live a long and good life. What happened to you is horrible, you need some help to deal with the trauma."
"Fight, fight, those jerks who did that to u should be feeling bad not u. Make those scums pay. File a lawsuit do something about it. U r strong.....  More power to you"
If you want to talk about then this is a safe sapce. You should ofcourse it isn't your fault
"Oh how painful that year must have been thinking you were at fault for something that was violent towards you. I tend to take responsibility for the actions of others thinking it must be my fault and I have hurtful influence over others. I’m told this isn’t true but it’s hard to accept that I didn’t need to blame myself. I feel for you that you’ve been blaming yourself for the actions of others. Rape is a crime and that by definition means you are not at fault. No one asks to be robbed, or hit, or raped. Nothing you did or said incited this crime. 

Sounds like you know this now. But knowing doesn’t always sink in to your feelings and body. I can see why you are depressed. Painful feelings for over a year can overwhelm us. It takes a toll. And it’s hard to just snap out of it. I hope you are starting to be gentle with yourself. Do you find it difficult to be gentle with yourself right now? It can be said easier than doing it. So sorry you’ve been hurting and struggling with this. Have you been afraid of talking to others about this?"
Stay alive. How they could do that to you and you're the one that has to feel bad about yourself is what this country encourages now and it's more than sad. You matter just as much as any one else and so does your wellbeing and safety.
"Rape is one of the most awful things a human can do to another and is never the victims fault. At the end of the day the rapist made the decision to do this disgusting act. 

Nobody deserves or enables that its not possible. Sure you can put yourself in a position where it could be easier to be a victim and this is still not you're fault. Usuay there are many factors and things are not so black and white. 

The only thing that is black and white to me is that rapist should be castrated then shot"
I absolutely understand how hard it must be for you to keep going. The fact that you're still fighting through each day is a true inspiration for me to deal with my own stuff tbh
Proud of you keep going ❤️
Thank you
Thanks... It's just too hard for me
Understandable. Know that reddit is a safe space
surely if i know ill always be a danger to others its my responsibility to kill myself
"Can you create a sheltered existence for yourself?

Can you take up meditation and similar natural healing efforts?

Have you looked into whether a temple or church will take you in to attempt to dedicate your life to service or reform?"
"if im around any people im dangerous. if im not around any people i cant care for myself and ill end up dead anyway. meditation etc doesnt help, i have severe schizoaffective disorder among other things and i need to be heavily medicated just to have any days at all where im lucid"
"What if you took a two week camping trip alone? Maybe after a while you'd eventually submit to hunger and feed yourself. It could be therapeutic.

Not an answer, just an idea."
i dont think you understand that i literally do not have the capacity to care for myself and i could enter a severe psychotic episode at any moment and without having my medication administered to me by someone else i will neglect my meds and lose all sense of reality. i also have an eating disorder and need people to ensure i eat. if im starving and do try to eat while in an episode i would just as likely try and eat a rock or random plant than remember i have food with me
"No, I didn't understand that. So you're dependent on the meds? What's the longest you've ever been off of them and not had any reality?"
"a week. i dont remember anything past the first day but apparently i was basically a drooling mess or a raging maniac the entire time, i had to be put back on my meds cos i tried to strangle someone"
"Were you experiencing reality in the 2 days before the strangle?

Why did you try to strangle someone?"
"no, i dont remember"
"You don't remember if you experiencing reality or no, you weren't experiencing reality?

Do you remember doing it or did you black out?"
"i do not remember anything past the first day of that week, i was so out of touch with reality the entire time. i dont even remember attacking the person, i just remember being told i did it and that was why i was being put back on my meds and pulled from the program where they took me off my meds"
I've been diagnosed with severe depression and my parents doesn't believe it.
"A lot of parents and guardians do this,I honestly don’t know why but apparently being anything but happy is alien to some people.Dont give in to the scrutiny,obviously it’s better said than done.If they don’t want to understand it then it’s a good chance that they never will.I don’t know your personal life so this might not be applicable,but I suggest talking more with friends.Theres a lot of groups online too you can find to let it all out but it’s up to you which path you take.I know a lot of people that hurt themselves trying to prove their point to others,all I can say is try your best not to succumb.I know it’s all easier said than done,but I hope this helps somehow"
"To the two people who actually reached out to me, goodbye"
"You definitely didn’t waste anyones time.

If you helped someone who was in a similar situation, I don’t think you would consider it a waste of your time.

Since helping is a selfless and noble thing to do.

I don’t know your current situation, so I can’t really say much on it.

Only God and you know what you are going through. It sounds real intense to me.

I’ll be praying for you.

Your pain and suffering are valid. 

I wish I knew what else to say."
Don't stop you can be a useless piece of shit with me :)
"You didn't waste my time. I'm proud of you for sharing your words and your thoughts. I know nothing about you but I feel for you. And I know one thing for sure. Out of 7-8 billion people in the world, you are the only you. You don't deserve this pain. You are the only you, if you have the strength, please try to give yourself any amount of love that you can"
You don’t waste anyone’s time.
Living is so damn painful.
"Yes, I’m in the same position, I also can’t continue, but idek how to end myself"
Honestly I feel empty
"Exactly. I feel like everyday is just going to progressively get worse until it’s so much more. I can’t imagine how more pain than this feels like. I can’t even end it, I don’t want to feel pain."
Why is it so damn hard to find any chat services after midnight
There are no chats? I make websites. Maybe I should create this
Yeah it's funny because late at night seems like the most useful time to have online chat services
I don't even know anymore
"I'm the same literally! The whole text you wrote is literally me right now. I lost all my friends, can't get a girlfriend, became socially awkward. Depression & anxiety are killing me. I only play video games too. Expect for family, but I feel like I'm losing them slowly too because of my behaving, but I'm trying, I'm trying to tell them that I'm not angry and I'm not  a bad person. I'm just sad."
Lmfao same. Dude way too many people are in this position now. Prob why so many young men are killing them selves now. This is pure torture.
Is it possible to rot while alive until you die?
"Yeah it’s called dehydration. That sounds like a very bad way to die, and you would have to be incredibly strong willed to let your self die of dehydration with access to water. Don’t please. Hope you get well."
"Theoretically, yes, but it's a very unpleasant way to go obviously. You'd probably just die of dehydration, no actual rotting required, but dying like that is just awfully painful from what I've read"
"as someone who’s gone days without food many times, your mind plays tricks on you. you start convincing yourself to eat, daydreaming about food, the level of pain is enormous"
"In theory. Dying from dehydration, however, is truly awful. I'm thinking of you, please take care."
I don’t know but I’m working on it.
A form of this was done through those of strong mental fortitude. I believe it was through Buddhism and some were eventually entombed as statues of worship. It is quite painful.
Then could I sue of starvation if I'm only drinking?
"Again, it would be extremely difficult and uncomfortable. And it would be uncomfortable for over a month."
"Technically yes, but as others have said it would take a long time and wouldn't be a fun way to go. Plus, when you force yourself to not eat for long periods of time you are likely to binge eat. You can't control it, your body takes over and you eat everything in sight. This can lead to eating disorders and trust me it will not help things at all and will only make things worse. Wish I could go back and stop myself from doing this."

Thanks for the heads up
Is there a typical time mark on their account? Or inconclusive?
"Hey how do I post on reddit? Sorry I’m new



It always says “sorry something went wrong”"
"Yeah a conglomerate of relationship subreddits gatekeeping human compassion and banning people whom actually take action to try to rid suffering in this world is pretty sick.

You get no end of karma whoring edgelords tormenting civil folk with their inane unpleasantries with no one left to downvote them.

Everyone just nod along with your one liner reply to show affirmation to this cult. I see so many casuals in this thread with dogma that was not born on the Internet but emotional baggage so personally contrived as to be wholly insane and irrelevant to any other human being.

If you are afraid to receive messages from people online then log off already its that easy."
I hate my eyes. I wish I could take them out.
"Are you in therapy? It sounds like all of you would benefit from it. I’m so sorry you dealt with such heinous abuse. But like others mentioned, you are not your father and your eyes are yours. He is unworthy of such lovely eyes. But you are worthy."
Why don't you try out color contacts?
"Here's an exercise that might help. Every day, go to the mirror, look yourself in the eye and compliment yourself. Do something that feels good, eat a delicious treat, but never break eye contact with yourself. If my theory is correct, eventually, your brain will link positivity with those eyes instead."
"It's so hard when you resemble the person who's abused you, I know that feeling 😔💖 But that doesn't make you who you are"
"My entire face looks like my dads. If I could, I’d switch faces in a heartbeat. I think finding someone else with the same color eyes and start associating it with beautiful things can help a whole lot."
"Even though you might have the same eyes, you’re not your father. Try being a better you 💕"
I can relate to this very much. I wish I had a solution (besides colored contacts)
"It's a long road but [here's](https://youtu.be/tybOi4hjZFQ) a place to start. Y'all have been conditioned but they are not his eyes, they are yours. It is your time to create a new meaning behind your eyes"
"OP, you deserve so much more. Please get therapy so that you can find peace with yourself. You really can have a much better life."
"I second this! UNIQSO has some nice, natural and comfortable contacts, pinky paradise too but their shipping can be pretty expensive"
Are any of these child abuses or am I just a spoiled brat?
"Yes, that's child abuse."
"I am sorry love, prayers for you ❤️"
"Baby, I was neglected too. I'm sorry, but just remember that it's not your fault and it's wrong. Reach out, find an adult that you trust and ask for help."
You’re being emotionally abused at home honey. This is ALL child abuse.
Can you tell me which one exactly?
Thank you... what do you think I should do?
It would be quicker to tell you which parts of that isn't child abuse
"Report it to a teacher, they are mandatory reporters"
So which one isn’t child abuse? Thanks.
What will they do if I report it? What if I’m just overreacting?
"You're not overreacting, I'm trained in childcare and a mandated reporter myself. This is all cause for major concern."
What usually happens when I report it? How do they confirm that it’s true? I don’t think my parents remember some of the events that happened and they’re from long time ago. I really appreciate your response.
am i the only one?
"“Trauma is not what happens to us, but what we hold inside in the absence of an empathic witness.”       -Peter A. Levine"
"I get that too, I've caught myself some nights talking to myself acting as if someone is there listening to me as I talk in full detail about everything that's happened to me lol"
"I agree!
What has helped me tremendously is writing it down when a thought appears, no matter how tangled or unfinished it is.
 I lean more towards poetry, as the complexity and mysterious element of this kind of writing, personally, makes it easier to express the more difficult or underlying train-of-thought feelings about my trauma and making it more personal, and like a kind of art for myself. 

However, I am sure other methods work such as simple sentences,  shorts etc. since writing it down can help you process it and get it out of your head for a while, to return to it when you might have a conclusion or a better understanding. 

I know this will not work for everyone, but as reading has always been an interest of mine, it also help me release by ""combining"" my PTSD with my bipolar disorder in expressing it in this way. 

Writing or screaming with words through my fingers onto my phone note app has quite literally SAVED my life."
"I’ve never really told the full story to anyone until I told it to my fiancé after being with him for almost 4 years. I’ve told bits and pieces to my ex best friend, who proceeded to add onto to the trauma. It took hours to explain everything I went through, and not even in the fullest of details either. 

What made and makes me feel heard, is writing and support groups like this. I’ve never really told my full story on here, and I don’t know if I plan to, but I’ll occasionally comment when I relate to something, to make myself and others not feel so alone. Maybe that could help you also? 

You’re not alone."
"This is so true, I feel the same way. ☹️"
Would writing your thoughts down in a journal help?
"Omg yes. I'm exactly here. It's been a little more than two years but I've never been able to get into the details of that phase. It's not like I don't want to speak about it, it's more like I don't want to freak people out by giving details. Well, either they don't care enough to be able to open up or they disbelieve. So there's that. 

So I am okay with being this way. When I'm asked, I speak. Else no one needs to know. You're not alone."
"this is why we go to therapy, but in the same time not everybody feels comfortable going there."
"I’ve had many therapists over the years and each one has helped me unbox my trauma. I’ve also been blessed to meet someone who is like minded and we can trauma bond. Building a support network may seem impossible, but it can be done. I’ve been at your place in the road, and it does feel hopeless at times. Shit I’m still struggling, but I’m better off today than I was 10 years ago. Here’s to hoping in 10 years I’m alive, and doing even better then. 

Hang in there! You aren’t alone!"
"Depending on what you went through it can be hard for others to process it. Without going into too many details I had to step in when a man on my local public transportation tried to assault an underage girl, and ever since then stories about child abuse of a sexual nature make me furious...I feel like I'm back on the train and ready to fight and kill someone. It's not like I don't want to hear people's stories about this, it's just that it fills me with rage and makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Hope this makes sense.

I grew up in a family where there was a lot of domestic violence...I was terrified to come home from school every day and dreaded the summers because I'd be out of school and stuck with my abuser for days and days and days, and those days were always exactly as I dreaded they would be. For fourteen years. I don't think I can adequately describe what that was like for people, and I think it's somewhat hard to hear, especially if someone hasn't gone through something similar. 

And I mean how could you? If you were raised in a loving family with lots of support hearing the story of someone who was raised in a family in the exact opposite circumstances how would you even process that?"
"I take comfort in the fact that there are other people like me in the world who kind of already know the full details of it if you will. I don’t need to ask. I already know that he or she systematically broke you down as a human being to get you to bend to his/her will and that the details are different from one abuser to the next but the behavior is the same.  Personally, I think the worst thing is not being able to answer with anymore detail than that because its too big and too awful to describe exactly what that feels like. We heard you."
I've written out and deleted/never posted maybe 50 posts about the abuse I experienced. I don't know why. I think it's in part out of shame and the fear of burdening others.
"Journaling is super helpful in this regard! If not, get it all out on r/trueoffmychest. I did it last night and it felt great."
"you’re not the only one. if i tell someone something traumatizing that happened to me, i usually just say it very vaguely and in a joking tone so they wont pity me


me: “yeah, my mom used to do that shit all the time. she even ditched me for her present boyfriend!!”


someone else: “🤨”"
Autobiographies can allow you to get your story out to those who want to hear every detail and thought. You can also walk away when it gets to be too much.. Makes a little money on the side too.
So do I.  And stupid for allowing it to happen!
this is true because i find myself talking in my sleep and talking to my various stuffed animals and dolls. i think i have a problem
I would advise righting out your thoughts on a piece of paper or journal. You could also dm me id youd like.
:(
"I do journaling :) It help a lot! its just that sometimes I want to tell my story to others but the shame takes over me, i fear of what reaction will i get, will they care enough? is it necessary? would it change anything? those are what I'm thinking, thats why i end up not saying anything at all. Maybe some things are better left unsaid."
"I have told my side (the are always2 sides) of the story 
to my spouse but not until the statute of limitations expired on any crimes committed by my ex . 
As is the exemption on spousal privilege, I protected my ex and my current spouse can’t squak. 
Something made sure to do to ensure I (and my kids) were safe. 
I’ll never regret this"
wow thank you
"I do this too, nobody empathizes with me like i do."
Yooooooo!! I do the exact same thing! LMAO I thought I was crazy when I did that because I had no one empathetic.
"that's a really great coping mechanism and i do journal too when it gets too much, it helps a lot. :)"
Good idea. The OP can also google for journaling exercises.
"Therapy can be amazing but IMO you have to find the right therapist. You have to be ultra comfortable with them to tell your deepest darkest secrets and still feel safe. I would say right now is probably the easiest it will ever be to find that as you arent limited to therapists in your physical area as they all are doing online sessions. This can be good for some as it takes a little bit of the anxiety and pressure away where you are only one click away from the safety of your own space again if things get too much and a bunch of other reasons that make it easier to start! 

But again you have to shop around for this and dont think that these therapists are a one shoe fits all as everyone needs something different and depending on who they are, how they talk to you and how you respond to their methods it may be the right fit the first time or even the tenth. But once you find the right person they can help you heal by filling in what you are missing and make you more than whole again. Its funny as sometimes all you need is someone to tell you your feelings and thoughts are not only valid but all your conclusions and methods to fix yourself are exactly what you need so you can do the work to get back what someone stole from you. Its usually not that they have some miracle cure but sometimes instead are there only to give you confidence in yourself and to tell you that you can trust yourself again and if you continue on doing what you are doing you will be better than ever."
"I hope one day when you are ready you can post your story as you deserve to be heard and to get all the love and support we all need! There is a ton of support on here and other forums that were created for just this purpose. Its a hard thing to do and isnt for everyone but if someone needs it they will find so many supportive people who either have gone through something similar or relate in someway. Its also important to grow your support network so its the solid ground to propel you upwards and each little piece of a person has their place taking a little weight off eachothers shoulders so its never a burden to any one person which is why these work so well. Its also usually helpful to share as its very likely that someone else is feeling exactly like you do but werent able to share themselves so our story could help someone else not feel so alone going through something similar. 

The most important thing though is getting this all out of our heads, and the best way to do this is writing it out, whether we share that with others isnt as important as writing it down for ourselves as its scientifically proven to be helpful letting us see our thoughts and feelings more clearly so we can start healing.

Either way I wish you the best and hope you see that if you tell your story or feelings in comments that they are never seen as a burden to anyone on here!"
"Yes, I do journal! That's very kind of you, thank you so much I appreciate it."
Like pulling a plug from your brain and letting it all flowwww
A normal experience?
It's not normal and it is abusive. It makes me sad to see this because my spouse has done this to our sons in the past and I would not take it. Mama bear definitely came out. I'm sorry your mother did not protect you from this.
What if I'm the bad one
"I understand completely and have also been in a super rough and just negative relationship. I wish I could help but you guys live together and I can't really just say ""leave him"" cause you can't. You can try to write down things he does if it gets worse or record some of it when you don't know what to do when the argument starts. If you wanna keep some peace try to do something together like have dinner or talk to him without blaming or arguing. Relationships like these are super hard when you feel like you need to get out but you can't I'm sorry you have been dealing with it. Just know!! None of this is your fault!! You two could maybe see a therapist together if your insurance could cover it. I'm so sorry again I hope you guys try to work things out. Keep me updated!"
"Oh no sweetheart. You’re not the bad one. He’s using this against you. Eventually, if things don’t get better you’re going to have to leave. This isn’t what you need or deserve. I know with the pandemic and you living together that might not be possible right now. But if you don’t see it getting better, like the other comment says, keep the peace until you can get out of there. You can’t make him change no matter what you do. Stay strong and keep us updated. 💜"
Finally got some Closure
"Aww, I’m glad to hear about this. Not always, but sometimes people can change for the better. I hope you and your mom can have many more happy memories together."
"There is something seriously wrong with me (TW: self-harm, abuse, suicide.) I just needed to tell my side to someone."
"Tl;dr I was groomed as a child and he broke up my happy relationship, so I dated him as an adult, but he played me, used me, and left me again."
"""I'm just stressed out"""
Is my dad abusive?
Yes this definitely sounds abusive . Also drug addiction can be a response to trauma so it shouldn’t be seen as a reason to not believe you
Can parents become abusive when you're a teenager?
I think i did something abusive to my boyfriend and i feel trash when i think about it.
Is my dad abusive
Just now realizing my experiences were abuse
Help with a narcissistic parent
I’m lucky it wasn’t worse. (CSA warning)
"I was sexually assaulted at my workplace a few years ago. All that happened was he held me in place, forcibly kissed me, and groped me. For a while I told myself that what happened wasn't even assault because he didn't actually rape me. It took a while to accept that just because others have had it worse didn't invalidate my own trauma. Point is, any time someone does something to you that you don't want, it's assault. No matter what anyone says, your trauma is valid. I'm so sorry it happens to you and I hope you're doing better."
"I was sexually abused by 5 close friends at the ages of 5-10. was never penetrated, never raped, but same things you went through. I go through trauma therapy and have talked to rape survivors who say to my experience that it doesn’t mean any less than their story and everyone handles things differently. You are not alone. There is a community out there for you, sexual assault\abuse can happen to anyone at any extent. You are valid, loved and understood by so many, I recommend group therapy with other survivors. Your choice but just know that I’m so sorry that happened, you are a SURVIVOR and I’m always here for you. Good luck on your journey. :)"
"I am so sorry for what you went through. That was wrong. I am speculating here but I think this information was too much for your mom to handle...from her perspective she probably feels guilty and like a bad mom because it happened on her watch. Also if she downplays it, it’s less severe in her mind. We are all here to validate your experience. It was wrong and I’m sorry your protector didn’t protect you or validate you. Take this tragedy and let it make you stronger and more aware. Thank you for sharing. ♥️"
"I have a similar story with my first kiss. I went to the movies with this guy and as soon as the movie started he started wanting to make out. And he forcibly took my phone away which scared the crap out of me. And then he eventually started to put his hands on my boobs and I’d push them away then he kept trying and even tried to go underneath my shirt and bra. 

It was 2 hours of him kissing on me and stuff. I was so uncomfortable and felt stuck. I first thought it was just my fault for not liking it but eventually I realized hey.. that was actually assault."
Thank you so much.
"Thank you, I thought maybe it was that as well she could be trying to make it less bad subconsciously because she also said how my cousin was also a kid that didn’t know what she was doing. Because she was 12. But I told her.. she did it to 3 little kids there’s no way she didn’t know and they were specifically sexual things. 
I think she may have felt bad because she looked sad  when she started to say that she tried to protect me from things like that by not letting me stay over with other family but even then it still happened.
Thank you so much 🖤"
Of course always here
I’m sorry that you went through that and thank you for sharing with me and simply taking your time to reassure me. I appreciate it 🖤
Anyone else?
"I dream about my father every night and wake up crying in the middle of the night. I understand what you mean, it's astonishing how much these terrible people live in our heads rent-free, even subconsciously. They're under every thought and behind every idea. It just sucks how hard it is to get rid of them.

I'm really sorry you were hurt this way, no one deserves that."
"PTSD tends to cause nightmares generally, and a lot of the time they’re about the trauma specifically"
"I often have dreams where I’m trapped at the home where I was abused by multiple people over 4 years. I’ll see my abusers in my dreams and feel afraid that they will hurt me. I get very disoriented when I wake up, and feel pretty messed up emotionally for the rest of the day. I’ve never woken up crying, but I have woken up with my arms defending me or kicking my legs. 

It really does suck, but at least we’re not alone in this."
"Thank you so much, I am very sorry for you as well ): you don’t deserve that ❤️"
"Awww, I’m so sorry ): That is so scary ): here for you if you need anyone!"
Thank you! I really appreciate it. I’m here if you need anyone also. :)
Thank you so much(:
could this be classifed child abuse?
"I hate having to give this answer, but classifying child abuse in cases like this (not physical/sexual) tends to be quite difficult. At the end of the day, it depends largely on how it affects the child in question. Does this leave them emotionally damaged or deprived? Do the parents consistently make the child feel unsafe in their own home? If you can establish either of these, you have reason to get CPS involved. But you really need to provide more details. I’m not seeing a case based on what you’ve described. If they refuse to let the child get a job after high school, that is a different story. It just sounds like shitty parenting right now."
"Regardless of the label, they should speak to a school guidance counselor about perhaps getting in to do the testing when they turn 18, and also apply for financial aid and other benefits that may help them pay their way without help.
They should also attempt to get emancipated because their parents are really holding them back.
I am so sorry to hear this is happening to your friend, and I hope you guys can find a solution together.

I personally see this as abuse, as I would not want to hinder my child from developing in these ways, but I don’t know if this technically classifies as abuse under the law. Worth looking into.

The social isolation is probably bad enough, let alone the added stress of all the other limitations...."
"Ultimately when they're 18 they can make any decision they wish. 

How do you know this person? Are you a fellow student? Parent of another child that is? If so you can contact the school's counseling department and voice your concerns. They have processes to investigate this."
"Hopefully, these sites can be useful to you. [1.](https://www.thehotline.org/) [2.](https://www.womenslaw.org/)The second link provides laws by states. I wish you guys the best of luck."
"I think intentionally neglecting your child's needs to properly integrate into society (Join school clubs, have friends, etc) isn't abuse but is neglect which can turn to abuse. It seems like intense controlling behavior that could spiral if your friend doesn't try to establish independence."
"Completely agree, I think it really depends on how it affects them. Hopefully they're able to see it as intense helicopter parenting (even though i would say it could be considered some type of abuse) and push through it for the next couple years until they can establish their independence."
I often call myself a monster.
"Don’t say that, you made a choice you’ll live with but there’s ways around that. You can get in vitro done. He hurt your mentality so bad you changed a part of yourself you can’t get back. 

I’ve been beaten for years before, had the same idea, as a woman you can’t get your tubes cut unless you have 3 kids already and not as easy to have that done as a man, but I would have too. 

Abuse causes people to self destruct. Don’t give in dude, you will be okay. Talk to some doctors to have the vitro surgery done for her, it’s around 10k and can be paid through insurance too (my family is military, my cousin covered a breast job done for his own wife, she had high risk cancerous cells, and had them reconstructed)"
thank you I'm a bit too old now to fix what I did. and no the rule is the same 3 kid minimum but was able to lie and said the mentally handicap sisters were blood so if that DNA came with it the navy might end up with disabled kids to pay for. they jumped at the idea to go snip snip and burn.
i never self-destructed i volunteered to stay in war zones so others would not need to. and that may be me self destructing but i thought it would be better if i fell than another.
I feel gross
People who have been abused often put themselves into the same abusive situations as a defense mechanism to relive the trauma as a way to better understand and control it.  This is totally normal.
"I understand but this is different. I get pleasure watching those women being abused. I’m not trying to understand or control what happened to me, this is all about pleasure and that’s why I think something’s wrong with me"
"Reframing what happened to you in a positive or even an enjoyable light is kind of a way of taking control back though, don't you think? Thinking that you liked it all along and hence why you couldn't have *really* been a victim is a much nicer mental image than the fact that someone 'managed' to victimize or humiliate you. And since you're obsessing over that one pornhub video (emphasis on the word; obsessing) it does sound like it was indeed pretty traumatic.

Maybe you fear that you must've secretly enjoyed the experience just to further twist the knife out of shame that you couldn't defend yourself and that you're now dirty and defiled. After all, he probably made you feel pretty dirty and objectified in that moment.

Or alternatively it could be that exposure to violent sexual content has desensitized you to such content and rewired your brain to seek it out. After all most porn today is pretty violent and degrading towards women."
