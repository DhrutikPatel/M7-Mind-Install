## Problem-Statement:
We often see many people sharing their emotions and sufferings during a call to their friends or relatives. India reported an average 381 deaths by suicide daily in 2019, totalling 1,39,123 fatalities over the year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. Seeing suicide as a major concern in our Country we thought of doing something to prevent suicides. In order to prevent suicide, it is necessary to detect suicide-related thoughts and user's suicide ideation in real-world by sentiment analysis method.

Along with that, sometimes it is also important to understand any abusive expressions of the person on the other side of a phone call in order to prevent any future casualities.
